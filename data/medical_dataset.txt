1318 diabetes care, volume 22, number 8, a ugust 1999although it is generally agreed that type 1 diabetes can have a signiﬁ c a n t e ffect on neuropsychological func- tion, it is unclear which clinical variables associated with type 1 diabetes pose the g reatest risk for cognitive impairment andwhich cognitive skills are most vulnerable to these risks. the two variables that have been most commonly investigated and r e l i- ably associated with cognitive impair m e n t a re age of onset of type 1 diabetes and a his- t o ry of severe hypoglycemia (1–6).based on neuropathological evidence (7–9), it has been proposed that severe hypoglycemia may pr e f e rentially harm neu- rons in the medial temporal region, speciﬁ- cally the hippocampus. subsequently , severe hypoglycemia may impair medial tempo- ral–mediated cognitive skills such as the ability to explicitly recall past events or con- sciously learned information after a delay (delayed declarative memory) (10,11). case studies have r e p o rted deﬁcits in delayed declarative memory after severe hypogly- cemia (10,12) with subsequent damage to the medial temporal region (12). pr e v i o u s re s e a rch has also suggested that, in patients with childhood-onset type 1 diabetes, severe hypoglycemia can have a signiﬁcant conse- quence for memory functioning that is inde- pendent of generalized disease effects (4). in one study , patients with type 1 diabetes who had a history of severe hypoglycemia de- monstrated signiﬁcantly impaired delayed declarative memory yet were r e l a t i v e l y u n i m p a i r ed on nondeclarative memory tasks (4). thus, severe hypoglycemia had a s p e c i ﬁ c (rather than diffuse) effect on neu- ropsychological functioning. the possibility that severe hypogly- cemia may be a risk factor for speciﬁc types of memory impairment in children has not been adequately tested. other studies have m e a s u r ed the change in cognitive function over time in children with type 1 diabetes, but none have used particularly sensitive m e m o r y tasks (13–15). in this study , we tested whether delayed declarative memory i m p a i r ment is detectable in a group of chil- d ren at higher risk for severe hypoglycemic episodes. we assessed memory skills in c h i l d r en with type 1 diabetes who had been randomly assigned at the time of diag- nosis to either intensive (it) or conven- tional (ct) diabetes therapy regimens. we p rospectively assessed severe hypoglycemic episodes and used experimentally derived tasks that have been closely linked to medial temporal functioning in addition to well-validated and clinically used tasks. the primary experimental tasks in this study are delayed response tasks (16–22). after damage to or disruption of compo- nents of

—s e v e r e hypoglycemia may impair medial temporal–mediated cognitive skills, such as the ability to recall past events explicitly (delayed declarative memory). the objective of this study was to determine whether delayed declarative memory deﬁcits are pr e s- ent in a group of diabetic children with an increased risk of severe hypoglycemia. research design and methods —nondiabetic children ( n= 16) and childr e n with type 1 diabetes who had been randomly assigned to either intensive (it) ( n= 13) or con- ventional (ct) ( n= 12) diabetes therapy at the time of diagnosis participated in the study . all episodes of severe hypoglycemia were prospectively ascertained. all children were tested on m e m o r y tasks that have been closely linked to medial temporal functioning and on r e a c t i o n time measur e s . r e s u lt s —our results demonstrated that the it group had a threefold higher rate of severe hypoglycemia, per f o rmed less accurately on a spatial declarative memory task, and per f o rm e d m o re slowly , but not less accurately , on a pattern recognition task than did the ct group or con- t rol subjects. in addition, both groups of type 1 diabetic children were signiﬁcantly impair e d on a motor speed task compared with their nondiabetic peers. c o n c l u s i o n s —these results indicate a selective relative memory impairment associ- ated with it that is consistent with the effects of severe hypoglycemia and medial temporal damage or dysfunction. if larger prospective studies determine that severe hypoglycemia is the mediating factor for this memory impairment, extreme caution in imposing overly strict stan- d a rds for glucose control in young patients with type 1 diabetes would be indicated because of the increased risk of hypoglycemia associated with it regimens. diabetes care 22:1318–1324, 1999tamara hershey , phd neilbhargava michelle sadler , rnneilh. w hite, md suzanne craft, phdp a t h o p h y s i o l o g y / c o m p l i c a t

associates humans and animals are able to per f o rm accurately in trials with short delays yet are i m p a i r ed in trials with longer ( .15–30 s) delays (19,21,23,24). thus, we pr e d i c t e d that children in the it group would expe- rience a higher rate of severe hypoglycemia and more impairment in delayed declara- tive memory (particularly as measured by delayed response tasks) compared with ct patients and control subjects. research design and m e t h o d s participants a total of 16 nondiabetic children and 25 children with type 1 diabetes were tested (aged 9–18 years; table 1). the dia- betic patients were r e c ruited from a lar g e r study conducted at the washington uni- versity school of medicine and st. louis c h i l d re n ’ s hospital, in which 34 childr e n (aged 6.9–16.7 years [mean 11.7]) were randomized at the time of diagnosis to either it or ct. children in the it group (n= 17) were expected to measure blood glucose at least 4 times daily and use 3–4 insulin injections per day or an insulin pump to keep their preprandial blood glu- cose level between 70 and 120 mg/dl. chil- d ren in the ct group ( n= 17) were expected to use 2–4 blood glucose deter- minations and 1–2 insulin injections per day to keep their preprandial blood glucose level between 80 and 180 mg/dl. the i m p o r tance of avoiding severe hypogly- cemia was emphasized in both gr o u p s . because the diabetic subjects in this study were r e c ruited at the time of diagno- sis and were carefully and pr o s p e c t i v e l y followed by the study staff (m.s., n.h.w . ) at least until the per f o rmance of the testing p rotocol, complete ascertainment of severe hypoglycemic episodes was accomplished. s e v e r e hypoglycemia was deﬁned by using the diabetes control and complications trial (dcct) deﬁnition (25), that is, episodes associated with severe neur o l o g i- cal dysfunction (e.g., seizure, loss of con- sciousness, disorientation, inability to a rouse from sleep) that r e q u i r e inter v e n t i o n with glucagon or intravenous dextrose or milder forms of hypoglycemia associated with neurological dysfunction that were not recognized by the patient or were not self- t reated. in the overall study population ( n= 34), the it group ( n= 17) had 3.3 times m o re episodes of severe hypoglycemia than c h i l d r en in the ct group ( n= 17) (80.0 vs. 24.4 episodes per 100 patient-years,respectively). the frequency of milder episodes of hypoglycemia, which were d e ﬁned as any experience of hypoglycemic symptoms that was recognized and tr e a t e d by the child or another individual before n e u rological impairment, was based on child or parent estimations of mild episodes during the previous month at their tri- monthly visits. these data are considered to be only estimates of the true rate of mild hypoglycemia and are less reliable than the m e a s u r ements of the frequency of severe hypoglycemia. of the 34 subjects in the overall study , one was not studied because of a hearing impairment, 4 moved away f rom the area before the testing pr o t o c o l , and 4 could not be scheduled in a timely m a n n e r . the subjects studied in the pr o t o- col included 13 from the it group and 12 f rom the ct gr o u p . in this study , 6 of the 13 it patients experienced severe hypoglycemia, wher e a s only 1 of 12 ct patients did. the it gr o u p averaged 85 episodes of severe hypogly- cemia per 100 patient-years compared with 28 in the ct group. this r e p resented a thr e e- fold higher incidence in the it group versus the ct group. on average, the last severe hypoglycemic episode occurred 6.1 months b e f o r e testing (sd = 3.3, range 3–11 months). due to the small group of patients that had severe hypoglycemia, we had lim- ited power to detect dif f e rences between g roups with and without hypoglycemic episodes. however, we did examine the means for each group and per f o rm an e x p l o r a t o r y re p e a t e d - m e a s u r es analysis of variance (anova) on critical task variables to determine if there were any trends con- sistent with our hypotheses. the it gr o u p also had more self-r e p o rted mild hypogly- cemic episodes than the ct group (an aver- age of 82 vs. 59 episodes r e p o rted during the course of the study). glycemic control was measured every 3 months by deter m i- nation of the total ghb by affinity chr o m a - tography (glycotest ii; pierce, rockford, il). subjects in the it group had lower ghb levels during their participation in the study than those in the ct group (8.26 vs. 9.96%) (f[1,22] = 6.99, p= .015). the three gr o u p s ( i t, ct, and nondiabetic) were similar in their demographic characteristics (table 1). procedure t ype 1 diabetic patients’ glucose levels were m e a s u r ed to determine that they were not hypoglycemic ( ,70 mg/dl) before begin- ning the testing. participants were then given a 2-h battery of tests to assess mem- o ry , motor speed, response inhibition, and general intelligence by a single trained experimenter (n.b.). rest periods were p rovided as necessary . memory spatial delayed response task. this task has been previously described (26). chil- d ren were r e q u i r ed to focus on a central ﬁx- ation point on a computer screen. while they remained ﬁxated, a cue appeared in 1 of 32 possible locations for 150 ms. a delay was then imposed for 5 or 60 s. dur- ing these delays, children per f o rmed an attention task requiring them to r e s p o n d whenever they saw a diamond shape appear in the center of the screen. after the d e l a y, children were r e q u i r ed to point to the place on the computer screen where they re m e m b e r ed seeing the cue. responses w e re measured in xand yc o o rdinates and c o m

in gr o u p s of three. each group of three was pr e s e n t e d for 10 s. children were instructed to mem- orize the patterns. after these study trials, either no delay occurred (condition 1) or a delay period of 4 min occurred (conditions 2 and 3). in condition 3, children were shown an additional 30 stimuli in groups of t h ree during the delay . the children then received 10 recognition trials. each r e c o g- nition trial consisted of three patter n s shown simultaneously for 10 s. the chil- d ren were instructed to indicate which one of the patterns had been shown in the pre- sentation trials. only 10 of the 30 originally p resented stimuli were tested in the r e c o g- nition phase. in condition 3, the stimuli in the second set of 30 were not tested because they simply

place them in their original loca- tions. thus, there is an immediate and delayed free recall for object names and for spatial locations. verbal and spatial r e - sponses were r e c o rded. this task

associated with early- onset type 1 diabetes (3). response inhibition task. this task has been previously described in detail (26). c h i l d r en were shown 30 trials in which a small block of color appeared randomly on a computer screen, and then the childr e n w e re asked to name the color. the childr e n w e re then shown 60 trials in which a block of color of the same size was in the center of a larger block of color and were again asked to name the color of the small block. on half of the trials, both blocks were the same color; on the other half of the trials, the blocks were dif f e rent colors, whichre q u i r ed the children to inhibit their response to the lar g e r, more pr o m i n e n t c o l o r. voice-onset times and accuracy were re c o rded and compared between condi-

the it group also had impaired memory p e rf o r mance on a sensitive measure of spa- tial long-term memory (spatial delayed response [sdr]) compared with the ct g roup and the nondiabetic group. in addi- tion, children in the it group had r e l a t i v e l y slow response times on a pattern memory task (dmsl). finally , both groups of type 1 diabetic children were signiﬁcantly im- p a i red on a ﬁne motor control and motor speed task (grooved pegboard) compar e d with their peers without type 1 diabetes. these results in part support our hypothe-sis that children with a higher risk of severe hypoglycemia are relatively impaired on sensitive tests of delayed declarative mem- o ry . however, these children were impair e d on only one of several declarative memory tasks. this ﬁnding suggests that there may be some relatively restricted risk of severe hypoglycemia in children with a later age of onset (aged .5 years), although this r e l a- tionship was only indirectly assessed in this s t u d y . these results also raise some methodological and theoretical questions. memory the relative impairment on the long delay condition of the sdr task in the it group is similar to previously r e p o rted ﬁndings in c h i l d r en (aged 7–16 years) and adults with left or right temporal lobe epilepsy (26,36). the it group per f o rmed 30% worse than the ct group or control subjects on the long delay , the pediatric epilepsy group per- f o rmed 40–45% worse than control sub- jects on the same long delay , and the adult epilepsy group per f o rmed 37% worse than c o n t r ol subjects on a longer delay (120 s). although it is possible that this pattern is related to general visuospatial impair- ment, this explanation seems unlikely for several reasons. first, the it group per- f o rmed poorly only on long delays, not the s h o rt delays of the sdr task. second, a pre- vious study (4) showed that type 1 diabetic patients with an early age of onset and a h i s t o r y of severe hypoglycemia per f o rm e d adequately on spatial tasks without mem- o ry demands. this ﬁnding is also unlikely f i g u r e 2— dmsl reaction time (median ± sd) collapsed across conditions for each

rentially with the long delay condition of the sdr task. f i n a l l y , the groups did not differ in their accuracy on tasks with a much higher demand on visual attention (dmsl). i n t e re s t i n g l y , children with temporal lobe epilepsy showed a similar pattern of p e rf o r mance on the sdr task (26). in addi- tion, these children did not show deﬁ c i t s on story recall or a task similar to the dmsl task. thus, our it group per f o rm e d in a manner similar to a group of childr e n with known temporal lobe dysfunction not only in terms of which tasks indicated i m p a i r ments but also in terms of the tasks on which they were not impaired. the fact that a group of children with known tem- poral lobe dysfunction per f o rmed similarly to children with type 1 diabetic under g o i n g it may indicate that similar mechanisms could explain both groups’ per f o rm a n c e s . it should be noted that the level of i m p a i r ment of the it group on the sdr task, although statistically signiﬁcant, may not cause any noticeable difficulty with daily functioning. however, this r e l a t i v e i m p a i r ment could be the beginning of a potential cumulative effect of it or severe hypoglycemia on memory per f o rm a n c e . after decades of type 1 diabetes and repeated severe hypoglycemic episodes, this impairment may become more notice- able on clinical memory tests (4) and could a ffect daily functioning. careful longitudi- nal studies are needed to test this hypothe- sis adequately . motor speed the response speed impairment found in it patients on the dmsl task could be related to difficulty in pattern r e c o g n i t i o n . it patients may take longer to inspect each option and match it to the memorized pat- t e rn, perhaps because their memory of the p a t t e r ns is less salient. however, in that case, we would have expected some d e c rease in the accuracy of per f o rmance as well, and this was not the case. inter e s t- i n g l y, on a similar pattern recognition task, slowed response time was found in adultswith temporal lobe epilepsy (36). a l t e rn a - t i v e l y, it patients may be slower to r e s p o n d to any difficult task. this group did not have distinct reaction time slowing on a voice reaction time task; however, this task was also relatively easy (per f o rmance accu- racy was $98% on all conditions). fur t h e r investigation is needed to determine the t rue nature of this impair m e n t . c h i l d r en with type 1 diabetes, r e g a rd- less of treatment group, were slower on a test of ﬁne motor speed and coor d i n a t i o n ( g rooved pegboard) than children with- out type 1 diabetes. slowed motor speed is a common ﬁnding in type 1 diabetes and has also been related to early onset of the disease and lower blood glucose levels (3,5,15,38). however, type 1 diabetic sub- jects were not hypoglycemic before under- going testing, and we found no corr e l a t i o n between blood glucose levels at time of testing and motor speed in the type 1 dia- betic group ( p.0 . 5 0 ) . summary in conclusion, these results suggest that some memory impairment may be associ- ated with it that is consistent with the e ffects of severe hypoglycemia (4) and medial temporal damage or dysfunction (19,21,23,24,39). although these patients did not show impairment on all of the declarative memory tasks administered, a similar pattern of per f o rmance has been re p o rted in children with known temporal lobe dysfunction, which supports the valid- ity of these results. the issue of cognitive risk due to severe hypoglycemia in childr e n with type 1 diabetes is important enough to w a rrant further consideration of these ﬁ n d- ings. only through further study of this issue can any strong conclusions be drawn. by following a larger group of type 1 dia- betic children longitudinally , we may be able to determine whether a direct r e l a- tionship exists between severe hypogly- cemia and cumulative risk to memory and other skills. such a ﬁnding may have s i g n i ﬁ cant consequences for the tr e a t m e n t of children and adolescents with type 1 dia- betes. for example, it may be necessary to be especially cautious in imposing overly strict standards for glucose control in young patients with type 1 diabetes b e c a u s e of the increased risk of hypoglycemia asso- ciated with it regimens (25), par t i c u l a r l y for adolescents (40,41). based at least in part on the results of the dcct (42), it has been assumed that the increased risk of severe hypoglycemiao b s e r ved during it in type 1 diabetes in teenagers and young adults is not associ- ated with permanent cognitive deﬁ c i t s . h o w e v e r , our results suggest that it is i m p o r tant to test this conclusion more rig- o ro u s l y , particularly in larger groups of chil- d ren and adolescents, by using pr o s p e c t i v e m e a s u r ement of hypoglycemia and sensi- tive memory tasks. if such an effect is con- ﬁrmed, the risk of it for younger patients could be greater than is generally accepted (43,44) because it may increase the risk of m e m o r y impairment in these children. on the other hand, it has many clearly demonstrated beneﬁts for patients with type 1 diabetes (45,46). without a clear demonstration of the relationship between s e v e r e hypoglycemia and memory deﬁ c i t s in children with type 1 diabetes on an it regimen, withholding or modifying this t reatment based only on the available data is unfounded. acknowledgments —this work was sup- p o rted in part by a

neurocognitive outcomes in young adults with early-onset type 1 diabetes a prospective follow-up study trang t. l y,fracp1,2 mikeanderson ,ma,phd3 kaitrin a. m cnamara ,ba1,3,4elizabeth a. d avis,fracp ,phd1,2,4 timothy w. j ones,fracp ,md1,2,4 objective dthe aim of this study was to reexamine the neurocognitive function of a cohort of young adults with early-onset type 1 diabetes and compare their cognitive function to a matched control group. we also examined whether cognitive function was related to prospec- tively obtained severe hypoglycemia history, lo ng-term glycemic control, or severe diabetic ketoacidosis. research design and methods dtesting included wechsler intelligence scale for children and adults, wechsler memory scale, cattell culture fair intelligence test (ccfit),wisconsin card sorting test (wcst), youth and adult self-report, and beck depression in- ventory. we tested 34 control subjects (mean 6se, age 19.5 60.5 years) and 33 type 1 diabetic subjects (age 19.3 60.5 years, age at type 1 diabetes onset 3.3 60.3 years, a1c from diagnosis 8.760.1%, and diabetes duration 16.0 60.5 years). results dthere was no difference in full-scale iq scores in type 1 diabetic and control subjects (100.7 62.0 vs. 102.5 61.4). there was no difference between groups in memory subtests or in reporting of emotional and behavioral dif ﬁculties. the type 1 diabetes group scored lower on the ccfit for ﬂuid intelligence compared with control subjects ( p= 0.028) and also scored lower on wcst with more perseverative errors ( p= 0.002) and fewer categories com- pleted ( p=0 . 0 2 2 ) . conclusions dthese data suggest no difference in general intellectual ability, memory, and emotional dif ﬁculties in our cohort of young adults with early-onset type 1 diabetes com- pared with control subjects and no deterioration over time. there were, however, ﬁndings to suggest subtle changes leading to poorer performance on complex tasks of executive function. diabetes care 34:2192 –2197, 2011 the impact of type 1 diabetes on the developing brain remains controver-sial. earlier age of diabetes onset has long been identi ﬁed as one of the stron- gest risk factors associated with cognitivedysfunction, ranging from poorer perfor-mance on general intellectual testing (1,2) to speci ﬁcd eﬁcits with visuospatial tasks, attention, and psychomotor ef ﬁciency. the effect of early-onset diabetes, how- ever, is confounded by the impact of re- current severe hypoglycemia. repeatedsevere hypoglycemia has been reported to adversely affect various cognitive do-mains, in particular long-term memory, attention, and verbal iq, although this has not been consistent across studies (3,4).moreover, many of these studies are limitedby their retrospective collection of hypogly- cemia history. we previously reported neurocogni- tive outcomes in 84 children with early- onset diagnosis of type 1 diabetes de ﬁned as type 1 diabetes onset before 6 years ofage (4). in that initial study, we compared those subjects who had a history of earlysevere hypoglycemia with those who had a history of late severe hypoglycemia and also compared those who had expe-rienced severe hypoglycemia with peerswho had no history of seizures. surprisingly, there were no group differences revealed on intellectual, memory, or behavioral meas-ures. furthermore, there was no evidence that episodes of seizure or coma, even those occurring in early childhood, resulted inbroad cognitive dysfunction, nor was there evidence of speci ﬁcm e m o r yd i f ﬁculties at t h et i m eo ft e s t i n g . in this study, we reevaluate the neu- rocognitive function of the cohort dwith onset of type 1 diabetes before age 6yearsdnow that they are young adults. this early-onset type 1 diabetes cohort is unique in that all subjects were initially recruited from a population-based cohortand have been prospectively followed from diagnosis with documentation of hypoglycemia rates and other key clinicaldata, including a1c, at regular 3-month clinic visits. our aims were, ﬁrst, to determine whether there had been any deteriora- tion in neurocognitive function in this population-based cohort of young adultswith early-onset type 1 diabetes over the10 years since they were previously tested. second, we sought for the ﬁrst time to com- pare the neurocognitive outcomes of thiscohort to a group of age- and sex-matched healthy young adults. finally, we aimed to determine whether cognitive function in thiscohort of patients with early-onset type 1 diabetes was related to their severe hypogly- cemia history, long-term glycemic control,or history of severe diabetic ketoacidosis. research design and methods dpatients with early-onset type 1 diabetes, de ﬁned

state are registered and treated there. previous studies have shown that this center has a case ascertainment close to 100%. allpatients have had ongoing prospective documentation from diagnosis at 3-month intervals of hypoglycemic events, diabeticketoacidosis, and glycemic control, mea- sured by a1c. severe hypoglycemia is deﬁned as coma or seizure associated with hypoglycemia. patient data were col- lected prospectively at routine clinic visits every 3 months using a speci ﬁcally de- signed data collection form completed by alimited number of physicians. the details of data collection have been documented previously (5). in summary, both patientsand parents were instructed on how to re- cord details of the hypoglycemic event, in- cluding blood glucose levels and responseto treatment. this information was subse- quently reviewed by the clinician and if val- idated, recorded on the data collectionform. the original type 1 diabetes cohort consisted of 84 children with early-onset type 1 diabetes (4). this cohort includedchildren with a history of early severe hy- poglycemia, de ﬁned as severe hypoglyce- mia occurring before the age of 6 years;those with a history of late severe hypo- glycemia, de ﬁned as severe hypoglycemia occurring after the age of 6 years; and thosewith early-onset diabetes with no history of severe hypoglycemia. recruitment oc- curred between 1999 and 2000, and neuro-cognitive assessment was performed at themean age of 10.0 years (range 6 –15 years). of these 84 subjects, 79 also went on to have neuroimaging with magnetic reso-nance imaging scans (6) and electroence- phalograms. ten years later in 2009, we contacted 77 of these subjects (98%) for repeat neuro- cognitive assessment, neuroimaging, and electroencephalogram. of those contacted,33 (42%) subjects attended both neuro-imaging and cognitive assessments. an additional eight participants attended neu- roimaging only. a total of seven patientsagreed to take part but did not attend three appointments arranged; three patients re- fused because of work or school commit-ments. an additional 17 patients refused, either with no reason given or because they did not wish to take part in research; and 9patients had moved, either interstate or to a rural/remote area. in addition to the early- onset type 1 diabetes cohort, 34 age- andsex-matched siblings of patients with type1 diabetes from the western australian type 1 diabetes database were recruited ascontrol subjects. control subjects reported no signi ﬁcant medical conditions and did not have type 1 diabetes. procedures subjects attended for 1 day of neurocog- nitive testing lasting w8 h. tests were ad- ministered by psychologists blind to the subjects ’medical history. there were set breaks for rest and meals. blood glucoselevels were obtained on arrival and at 2-h intervals for the type 1 diabetes cohort. levels were maintained between 4 and15 mmol/l for the duration of neurocog-nitive testing. neurocognitive measures wechsler intelligence scale for chil- dren and wechsler adult intelligence scale. general intellectual ability was measured using the wechsler intelli- gence scale for child ren, fourth edition (wisc-iv) (7) for subjects ,16 years old and the wechsler adult intelligencescale, fourth edition (wais-iv) (8) for subjects aged $16 years. eight core sub- tests (block design, similarities, digit span,coding, vocabulary, letter-number se- quencing, matrix pea soning, and symbol search) and two supplementary subtests(picture completion, and information) were administered. full-scale iq, verbal comprehension, perceptual reasoning,working memory, and processing speed index scores were computed by combin- ing age-scaled subtest scores. while thew i s c - i va n dw a i s - i va r en o te n t i r e l ycomparable, the correlation for full scale iq scores between both tests is 0.91. this suggests that they are measuring highlysimilar constructs. wechsler memory scale. memory was measured using the wechsler memoryscale, fourth edition (wms-iv) (9). the wms-iv is an individually administered battery that provides subtest and compos-ite scores that are used to assess variousmemory abilities in individuals aged 16 – 90. the current study used three subtests (logical memory, verbal paired associates,and visual reproduction) administering both immediate and delayed-recall com- ponents. these subtests were used tocompute three index scores (auditory memory, immediate memory, and delayed memory). while the wms-iv is designed to assess memory in individuals $16 years old, subjects aged 14 and 15 years in thecurrent study were also assessed using thistask. previous research by paniak et al. (10) assessed subjects aged 9 –15 years on thewechsler memory scale –revised and found that this age-group had percentage recall scores for the logical memory and visual reproduction subtests similar toadult percentage recall scores. typically, in- dividuals aged #16 years are assessed us- ing the children ’s memory scale (cms); however, there are dif ﬁculties in transfer- ring scores from the cms to the wms-iv when calculating a group total. correla-tions between indexes on the cms and the wms-iv differ greatly (range: r= 0.25 –0.70). as a consequence, scaled scores for seven subjects younger than the age of16 were computed using normative data for subjects aged 16 years. cattell culture fair intelligence test.fluid intelligence was measured using the cattell culture fair intelligence test (ccfit). the ccfit assesses novelproblem-solving ability without relying on the use of knowledge that is speci ﬁc to certain cultures. as a consequence, theccfit aims to measure intelligence in-dependent of cultural experience, educa- tional level, or verbal ability. this is aided by the task being largely nonverbal innature, reducing the bias that is often found in more crystallized measures of ﬂuid in- telligence. the task consists of four timedsubtestsdseries, classi ﬁcations, matrices, and conditions dthat test subjects ’ability to perceive the relationship between ﬁgures and shapes. raw scores for each of the sub- tests were converted into age-adjusted scaled scores (11), which were used tocalculate a total score.wisconsin card sorting test. the wisconsin card sorting test (wcst) (12) is a measure of executive function.the wcst assesses the execution of func- tions such as set-shifting, concept forma- tion, and problem solving in response totester feedback. the subjects were presented with four pictographic reference cards that were different in color, form, and number.subjects were then presented with a deck ofstimulus cards and asked to match each card to one of the four reference cards in whichever way they thought best. withoutbeing informed, the participant was re- quired to match cards using the rules of color, form, or number. throughout thetest, the administrator provided feedback to the subject, indicating to them whether they were correct or incorrect. once thesubject had achieved 10 correct matches in a row, the matching rule was changed without the subject ’s knowledge. psycho- metric scores were generated from thewcst, the primary score being the number of perseverative errors made before the care.diabetesjournals.org d iabetes care,volume 34, o ctober 2011 2193ly and associatesdownloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/34/10/2192/607275/2192.pdf by guest on 13 january 2025 subject realizes that the matching-criterion rule has changed. youth self report and adult self report. aspects of adaptive functioning and other behavioral problems were mea- sured using the achenbach youth self report (ysr) (13) and adult self report(asr) (14). subjects aged $18 years were administered the asr, whereas the ysr was administered to subjects aged ,18 years. both questionnaires consist of eight indexes: anxious/depressed, attention prob- lems, withdrawn, aggressive behavior, so-matic complaints, rule-breaking behavior,thought problems, and intrusive behavior. scores on the separate indexes form inter- nalizing and externalizing scores that wereused to calculate a total score. beck depression inventory. symptoms of depression were evaluated using thebeck depression inventory, second edi- tion (bdi-ii) (15). the bdi-ii is a 21-item self-report questionnaire that assesses theintensity of depression in both clinicaland normal population groups. state-trait anxiety index and state- trait anxiety index for children. anx- iety was measured using the state-trait anxiety index (stai) for subjects aged .15 years and the state-trait anxiety in- dex for children (stai-c) for subjects aged#14 years (16,17). the stai and the stai-c are self-report instruments thatmeasure and distinguish between both the temporary condition of state anxiety and the long-standing quality of trait anxiety. laboratory measurements a1c was measured at each 3-month visit. a1c was assessed by an agglutination in-hibition immunoassay (ames dca 2000; bayer ltd., mishawaka, in). the inter- and intra-assay coef ﬁcients of variation were 2.5 and 2.3%, respectively. statistical analysis clinical characteristics of the groups werecompared using student ttest (mean 6 se) for variables normally distributed. results clinical characteristics the clinical characteristics of the early- onset type 1 diabetes cohort are shown in table 1. subjects with early-onset type 1diabetes who attended for follow-up neuro- cognitive assessment did not differ from those who did not participate in the follow-up study with respect to age, duration of di-abetes, mean a1c from diagnosis, or a1c at their last visit. the proportion of subjectswith a history of early severe hypoglyce- mia, late severe hypoglycemia, and no his- tory of severe hypoglycemia did not differbetween those who attended and those who did not. subjects who attended for follow-up testing performed similarly to those who did not attend on the wechsler intelli- gence scale for children, third edition(wisc-iii); cms; achenbach child be-havior checklist; and children ’s depres- sion index at baseline testing. both groups were also similar in terms of grayand white matter volumes and left and right hippocampal volumes measured by magnetic resonance imaging. the propor-tion of subjects reported to have mesial temporal sclerosis was also similar in both groups ( p= 0.44). the index of rel- ative socioeconomic advantage and dis-advantage published by the australia bureau of statistics (18) was used to de- termine the socioeconomic status of ourcohort. almost half (45%) of the type 1 diabetes group were classi ﬁed as being in the highest quintile of least socioeco-nomic disadvantage, with 6% being in the lowest quintile or group of highest disadvantage. this is in keeping withour epidemiological studies showing that the incidence of type 1 diabetes was higher in higher socioeconomic groups(19). our control population was similarto our type 1 diabetes cohort in terms of socioeconomic status. our type 1 diabe- tes cohort was largely white with one sub-ject of indian descent. all of our control subjects were white. cognitive tests table 2 shows scores from the cognitive assessment for the early-onset type 1diabetes cohort and control subjects. there were 33 type 1 diabetic subjects assessed at the mean age of 19.3 60.5 years. there were 34 age- and sex-matched control subjects also assessed at the meanage of 19.5 60.5 years. there was no dif- ference in full-scale iq scores in the type 1 diabetes cohort compared with control subjects (100.7 62.0 vs. 102.5 61.4; p= 0.466), nor were there any differences on the four index scores of verbal compre- hension, perceptual reasoning, working memory, and processing speed ( p=0 . 9 7 1 , p= 0.504, p= 0.862, and p= 0.235, respec- tively). there were no differences observed between the type 1 diabetes group and con-trol subjects with wms-iv subtests of audi- tory memory, immediate memory, and delayed memory ( p= 0.825, p= 0.757, andp= 0.368, respectively). the type 1 diabetes group scored lower on the ccfit compared with control sub- jects (109.5 62.3 vs. 117.8 62.9; p= 0.028 with effect size of 20.53). with a conservative bonferroni correction, this would just fail to reach the appropriatelevel of signi ﬁcance required. nevertheless, the effect size for the ccfit is approxi- mately seven times the mean effect sizefor the null results. moreover, the type 1 diabetes group also scored lower on the wcst with more perseverative errors andfewer completed categories than the con-trol group ( p= 0.002 and p=0 . 0 2 2 ,r e - spectively), usually taken to be indicators of processes related conceptually to ﬂuid in- telligence. there were no differences between groups in reporting of emotional andbehavioral dif ﬁculties assessed by both ysr and asr ( p= 0.947). there was also no difference in reporting of depressivetable 1dclinical characteristics of early-onset type 1 diabetes cohort clinical characteristic type 1 diabetestype 1 diabetes (did not participate in follow-up study) p sample size (% of original cohort) 33 (42) 46 (58) age (years) 19.3 60.5 19.1 60.4 0.758 male (%) 15 (45) 21 (46) 0.986duration of diabetes (years) 16.0 60.5 16.0 60.5 0.950 mean a1c from diagnosis (%) 8.7 60.1 8.7 60.1 0.841 a1c at last visit (%) 8.8 60.3 8.8 60.2 0.874 severe hypoglycemia history dsubjects in each group (%) early severe hypoglycemia 6 (18) 13 (28) 0.301 late severe hypoglycemia 14 (42) 20 (43) 0.926never had seizure/coma 13 (40) 13 (28) 0.299 data are n(%) and mean 6se. 2194 diabetes care,volume 34, o ctober 2011 care.diabetesjournals.orgtype 1 diabetes and the braindownloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/34/10/2192/607275/2192.pdf by guest on 13 january 2025 symptoms between groups assessed by bdi-ii ( p= 0.762). scores for both state and trait anxiety were also similar for both groups ( p=0 . 9 0 9a n d p=0 . 7 3 7 , respectively). severe hypoglycemia results of the cognitive tests by history ofsevere hypoglycemia are shown in table 3. there was no difference between the early, late, and no history of severe hypoglyce-mia groups in full-scale iq scores and in- dexes, memory subtests, and ccfit scores. the early severe hypoglycemia sub-group did, however, complete fewer cate- gories in the wcst compared with control subjects ( p=0 . 0 2 8 ) . a1c the mean a1c from diagnosis for the type1 diabetes group was 8.7% (range 7.2 – 10.2). there was no difference between full-scale iq scores for subjects in the high- est a1c quartile or lowest a1c quartilecompared with control subjects ( p= 0.519 and p= 0.918, respectively). in ad- dition, there was no difference in full-scaleiq scores or other neurocognitive measurestested for subjects with a history of severe diabetic ketoacidosis versus those with no history of severe diabetic ketoacidosis. microvascular complications microvascular complications were assessed in the type 1 diabetes group according tostandard clinical guidelines, including clin-ical examination, annual retinal examina- tion by an ophthalmologist, and annual morning urine testing for microalbuminuria.at the last urinalysis, 3 of our 33 participants had evidence of microalbuminuria. none of the subjects had evidence of clinicallysigniﬁcant diabetic retinopathy. the three subjects with microalbuminuria did not demonstrate poorer performance on thecognitive tests. comparison with previous wisc-iii resultsthe mean full-scale iq results for the original type 1 diabetes cohort ( n= 84) was 104.3 61.3 on the wisc-iii. for the subset that attended for the follow- up study ( n= 33), their follow-up full- scale iq result was 100.7 62.01 on either the wisc-iv or wais-iv compared withthe previous mean full-scale iq result of 106.262.1 scored on the wisc-iii 10 years earlier. conclusions dthis study is the ﬁrst to examine a population-based co- hort of children diagnosed with diabetesbefore the age of 6 years and followed longitudinally for w16 years from diag- nosis and to have prospective documen-tation of severe hypoglycemia history collected in a rigorous and systematic manner. many previous studies have re-lied on retrospective assessment. a1c wasalso recorded from diagnosis, allowing, for the ﬁrst time, an assessment of the effect of glycemia during childhood on cognitivedevelopment. we found no differences in tests of general intellectual ability, memory, and emotional dif ﬁculties compared with age- and sex-matched healthy control sub- jects. a history of early seizure or coma as- sociated with hypoglycemia occurringbefore the age of 6 years was not associatedwith lower full-scale iq scores in young adults with early-onset type 1 diabetes. overall, these are reassuring ﬁndings for families with young children with type 1 diabetes. the type 1 diabetes group did, how- ever, score lower on speci ﬁct e s t so f ﬂuid intelligence and complex tasks of executive function. northam et al. (20) also foundsimilar poorer performance on measures of executive function and processing speed. while processing speed has also beenlinked to ﬂuid intelligence, the correspon- dence between de ﬁcits in the ccfit and the wcst suggests that the link has more to do with executive functioning and, inparticular, the processes associated with prefrontal cortex. such cognitive processes include inhibition, set-shifting, goal main-tenance, and other processes considered the foundations of ﬂuid intelligence. exec- utive functions allow individuals to per-form behaviors that are independent andself-serving. such behaviors are needed in situations where habitual behaviors and re- sponses are not appropriate, such as mul-titasking, deciding between two different alternatives, and mental planning. it is in- teresting to speculate on the impact thatdefects in executive function may have for diabetes self-care behaviors, particularly in view of the increasing demands on patientsand the complexity of such care. executive function tasks appear to be more signi ﬁcantly affected in the early severe hypoglycemia subgroup, suggestingthat there may be subtle developmental changes in the frontal cortex. our numbers,table 2dresults from neurocognitive tests type 1 diabetes control pcohen d effect size sample size 33 34 age (years) 19.3 60.5 19.5 60.5 0.781 wisc-iv and wais-iv

2025 however, are small in the early seizure subgroup. rovet and ehrlich (21) also dem-onstrated poorer performance on the wcst in the seizure group in their 7-year follow-up study of children with type 1 di-abetes. these ﬁndings suggest that a history of early seizure may be associated with sub- tle developmental changes, leading topoorer performance on complex tasks ofexecutive function. both acute hyperglycemia (22) and chronic hyperglycemia (23) have alsobeen implicated in causing cognitive dys- function in children with type 1 diabetes. in our group, we found no difference infull-scale iq in our subjects with higher mean a1c or lower mean aic compared with control subject s, suggesting that chronic hyperglycemia was not associatedwith poorer general intellectual ability in this cohort. this may be in part due to the reasonably tight range of a1c for this co-hort. the possibility that there is an inter- action between glycemic control and severe hypoglycemia cannot be discounted, butlarger prospective studies would be re- quired to explore this issue. for the type 1 diabetes cohort, when comparing the full-scale iq scores on wisc-iv and wais-iv to the previous results obtained from the wisc-iii, thereappears to be a drop of 5.5 iq pointson follow-up testing. this apparent de- cline should be treated with caution. newintelligence tests are restandardized so that the population mean is set at 100as a result of the flynn effect (24), a phe- nomenon where performance on intelli- gence tests is improving on average byw3–4 iq points per decade (25). in prac- tice, this means that the same level of per- formance on a new version of a test will bescaled to a lower iq score. taking intoaccount the flynn effect, there is no sig- niﬁcant deterioration in this cohort over the 10 years (current 104.7 62.0 vs. pre- vious 106.2 62.1; p= 0.150). we con- clude that there was no deterioration in full-scale iq scores in our cohort after 10years of childhood type 1 diabetes. acknowledgments dno potential con ﬂicts of interest relevant to this article were reported. t.t.l. contributed to study design, re- searched data, and wrote the manuscript. m.a. contributed

improvements in the life expectancy of type 1 diabetes the pittsburgh epidemiology of diabetes complications study cohort rachel g. miller,1aaron m. secrest,1ravi k. sharma,2thomas j. songer,1and trevor j. orchard1 survival in type 1 diabetes has improved, but the impact on life expectancy in the u.s. type 1 diabetes population is not well established. our objective was to estimate the life expectancy of the pittsburgh epidemiology of diabetes complications (edc)study cohort and quantify improvements by comparing twosubcohorts based on year of diabetes diagnosis (1950 –1964 [ n= 390] vs. 1965 –1980 [ n= 543]). the edc study is a prospective cohort study of 933 participants with childhood-onset (aged ,17 years) type 1 diabetes diagnosed at children ’s hospital of pitts- burgh from 1950 to 1980. mortality ascertainment was censored31 december 2009. abridged cohort life tables were constructedto calculate life expectancy. death occurred in 237 (60.8%) of the1950 –1964 subcohort compared with 88 (16.2%) of the 1965 –1980 subcohort. the life expectancy at birth for those diagnosed1965 –1980 was ;15 years greater than participants diagnosed 1950 –1964 (68.8 [95% ci 64.7 –72.8] vs. 53.4 [50.8 –56.0] years, respectively) ( p,0.0001); this difference persisted regardless of sex or pubertal status at diagnosis. this improvement in lifeexpectancy emphasizes the need for insurance companies toupdate analysis of the life expectancy of those with childhood-onset type 1 diabetes because weighting of insurance premiums is based on outdated estimates. diabetes 61:2987 –2992, 2012 several worldwide studies have shown that sur- vival in type 1 diabetes has improved over time (1–9). however, formal assessments of life ex- pectancy of people with type 1 diabetes are rel- atively rare, and the most recent we found was published in 2001, where brown et al. (10) reported a life expectancy at birth of 59.7 years in a subset of the canterbury di- abetes registry (new zealand) cohort diagnosed with di- abetes when aged younger than 30 years and that began insulin therapy within 12 months of diagnosis. in 1999,borch-johnsen (3) reported an increase in life expectancy of 15 years over a 50-year period up to 1982 in a danish type 1 diabetes cohort. the life expectancy of individuals with type 1 diabetes in the u.s. seems to have been last formally assessed in 1975 by goodkin (11), who reported that life expectancy in type 1 diabetes (diagnosis age ,15 years) was reduced 27 years compared with individuals without diabetes in a life insurance cohort. using national health interview survey data from 1984 to 2000, however,narayan et al. (12) estimated that u.s. children diagnosed with diabetes at age 10 years lose an average of ;19 life- years. similarly, the estimated life expectancy for people with diabetes was 13 years less than people without di- abetes in ontario, canada; however, this estimate included type 1 and type 2 diabetes (13). the pittsburgh epidemiology of diabetes complications (edc) study cohort provides a unique opportunity to ex- amine mortality and life-expectancy changes over time ina u.s. cohort with long-term ( .30 years) follow-up, be- cause the participants were all diagnosed with childhood- onset type 1 diabetes between 1950 and 1980. to determine if, and to what degree, life expectancy has improved, this article compares two subcohorts based on year of type 1 diabetes diagnosis (1950 –1964 vs. 1965 –1980). we further assess the representativeness of the edc cohort by comparing the 1965 –1980 subcohort with the population- based allegheny county type 1 diabetes registry (acr) of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes. research design and methods the pittsburgh edc study is a prospective cohort study of childhood-onset (age ,17 years) type 1 diabetes. all participants were diagnosed or seen within 1 year of diagnosis at children ’s hospital of pittsburgh between 1950 and 1980. potential participants were identi ﬁed using hospital records and were con- sidered eligible for the study if the record noted a clinical diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. the cohort has been described in detail elsewhere (6). brie ﬂy, 933 individuals were studied, with 658 participating in the edc study baselineexamination between 1986 and 1988 and 130 completing questionnaires only.the remaining 145 participants died before the baseline examination in 1986.a comparison of these 145 individuals and those who survived and partici-pated in the study baseline assessment is provided in table 1. mortality status ascertainment was censored at 31 december 2009. as of that date, vital status was known for 878 individuals ( .94%). the 55 individuals with unknown status were censored at the last date each was known to be living. deathcertiﬁcates and hospital, autopsy, and coroner reports were obtained, as ap- propriate, to document mortality for all participants who died during the fol-low-up period, including the 145 who died before the edc study baselineexamination, and were reviewed by a physician mortality classi ﬁcation com- mittee. the correlation between age and duration of type 1 diabetes at time of study baseline was assessed using pearson correlation. the edc study pro-tocol was approved by the university of pittsburgh institutional review board.informed consent was obtained in writing from the participants. to explore changes in survival, before analyses, the participants were di- vided into two groups by year of type 1 diabetes diagnosis: 1950 –1964 and 1965 – 1980. this method of division was chosen because it divides the period into two equal halves, and data would become sparse if smaller time periods, suchas by year, were used. the difference in observed survival between the twosubcohorts was visually assessed using kaplan-meier curves and the log-rankstatistic. abridged life tables were constructed using the cohort approach,where individuals in a group, in this case, individuals diagnosed with type 1diabetes during two speci ﬁc periods of time, are followed up through their lifetime to describe the mortality experience of the group. life-table intervals were de ﬁned as the age groups 0 –1 year, 1 –5 years, and by 5-year intervals thereafter. the information used to calculate the life-table statistics includesthe total population alive at the beginning of each interval, the number ofdeaths occurring in each interval, and the number of persons censored within from the1department of epidemiology, graduate school of public health, university of pittsburgh, pittsburgh, pennsylvania; and the2department of behavioral and

death and survival by the end of each interval, conditional on being alive at the beginning of the interval. by de ﬁnition, this cohort has survived to the age of type 1 diabetes diagnosis and, therefore, had no prior death. therefore, a keyassumption of this analysis is that the life tables and resulting life expectancyestimates are conditional on living to childhood-onset type 1 diabetes diagnosis. because the edc study has a large proportion of individuals who are currently living, the true maximum life span of the cohort has not been ob- served. therefore, before the life tables were constructed, the terminal age wasestimated by extrapolation of weibull accelerated-failure time curves based onobserved mortality patterns to the age at which the probability of survival in thisstudy cohort approximates zero. the weibull distribution was chosen to es-timate the terminal age because it is a ﬂexible distribution used to model survival times and life-span data. the terminal age was estimated to be ;85 years old for the total cohort. it is necessary to use the same terminal age forboth subcohorts because setting this age at different values would lead to anoverestimated difference in life expectancy. another consequence of having surviving study participants is that the entire survival curve has not been observed, and thus, the survival function for the ageintervals with censored observations must be estimated. therefore, the com- putation of these life tables was based on the methodology described by chiang (14), using the maximum likelihood exponential adjustment of the probabilityof death for censored data (15). when this method is used, individuals arecensored at the age they were last known to be living, and the event rates forincomplete segments (i.e., the age intervals with censored observations) areassumed to have an underlying exponential distribution, using chiang ’s (14) maximum likelihood formula and including the information from the observed deaths within the interval (15). conditional life expectancy for each age interval (i.e., the average number of years of life remaining in participants who attained the age at the beginning ofthe interval) was calculated and compared using a two-sided paired ztest across the diagnosis subcohorts. this report focuses on conditional life ex- pectancy at birth because this is the most frequently cited statistic derivedfrom life-table analysis due to its intuitive interpretation of mean age in yearsat death. in addition, life expectancy at various ages is presented in the tables.comparisons of life expectancy were made across the two diagnosis sub-cohorts by sex and by puberty status at diagnosis because pubertal onset of type 1 diabetes has been shown to be associated with an increased risk of death compared with prepubertal onset (16). pubertal onset of type 1 diabeteswas de ﬁned as an age of diagnosis of $11 years for female and $12 years for male participants. a signi ﬁcance level of a= 0.05 was used for all statistical tests. all life table and life expectancy calculations were performed usingsurvival 10.0 software (17). for validation, data from the population-based acr were used. the acr (n= 1,075), which has been described in detail (18), includes all individuals diagnosed with childhood-onset (aged ,18 years) type 1 diabetes in allegheny county (pittsburgh, pa) between 1965 and 1979 and prescribed insulin atdiagnosis. individuals were identi ﬁed via hospital record review and validated by contacting pediatricians throughout the county (ascertainment .95%) (19). only individuals diagnosed at age ,17 years were included in this analysis to match the inclusion criteria of the edc study. children who developed diabetes from a secondary cause (i.e., cystic ﬁbrosis, down syndrome, or steroid-induced diabetes) were excluded. vital status has been determined asof 1 january 2008, when a search of the national death index was conducted,and total (8) and cause-speci ﬁc mortality (20) have been reported. the acr includes 271 participants who are also participants in the edc 1965 –1980 diagnosis cohort. for a descriptive comparison of the improvement in life expectancy be- tween the edc and u.s. general population, u.s. life tables were used (21). toobtain estimates for the general u.s. population during the same

(1957 and 1972, respectively). the life tables for caucasianswere used for comparability because the edc cohort is 98% caucasian. inaddition, life expectancy at age 8 was used because this was approximatelyequivalent to the median year of type 1 diabetes diagnosis in the edc cohortand the life-expectancy estimates are conditional on surviving to the age of diagnosis. results the characteristics of both edc cohorts (overall and diagnosis years 1950 –1964 and 1965 –1980) and acr (1965 –1979) are presented in table 2. the proportion of participants in the edc who were female was slightly lower in the 1950 –1964 subcohort, with 46.2% being fe- male, compared with 52.1% in the 1965 –1980 subcohort (p= 0.07). the mean age at onset was signi ﬁcantly younger in the 1950 –1964 subcohort compared with the 1965 –80 subcohort (7.9 vs. 8.6 years, respectively, p= 0.01). in the 1950 –1964 subcohort, the distribution of the age at diagnosis was 26.4% at ,5 years, 39.0% at 5 –9 years, 32.3% at 10 –14 years, and 2.3% at $15 years old. the distribution of age at diagnosis in the 1965 –1980 subcohort was 21.2% at ,5 years, 36.7% at 5 –9y e a r s , 38.1% at 10 –14 years, and 4.1% at $15 years old. likewise, the proportion of participants with pubertal onset of type 1 diabetes was lower in the 1950 –1964 compared with the 1965 –1980 subcohort (21 vs. 28%, respectively, p=0 . 0 2 ) . the overall edc cohort was followed up for a total of 30,127.6 person-years, with 13,555.7 from the 1950 –1964 subcohort and 16,571.9 person-years from the 1965 –1980subcohort. the mortality rate was three times greater in the 1950 –1964 subcohort compared with the 1965 –1980 subcohort (1,748 [95% ci 1,525 –1,971] vs. 531 [420 –642] per 100,000 person-years, respectively; p,0.0001). the acr showed a higher mean age at onset and death than the later edc cohort. as shown in the kaplan-meier curves in fig. 1, crude survival was greater in the more recent (1965 –1980) sub- cohort (log-rank test p,0.0001) than in the earlier cohort. however, the later edc and acr cohorts had similar survival (log-rank test p= 0.10). table 3 reports the ob- served probability of death and the life expectancy at various ages for the two edc diagnosis subcohorts. thelife expectancy at birth for the participants diagnosed with type 1 diabetes between 1950 and 1964 is 53.4 years compared with 68.8 years for participants diagnosed be- tween 1965 and 1980, an increase of .15 years ( p,0.0001). a similar increase in life expectancy between the two di- agnosis subcohorts persisted, regardless of sex, age at di- agnosis, and pubertal status at diagnosis (table 4). table 3 shows the observed probability of death and life expectancy at various ages for the 1965 –1980 edc cohort and the acr, for individuals diagnosed at age ,17 years, as in edc, during the same period of time. the life expectancy at birth in the population-based acr cohort is estimated to be 67.2 years, which is 1.6 years less than the estimated life expec- tancy of the comparable edc cohort; this difference did not reach statistical signi ﬁcance ( p= 0.49). the estimated life expectancy for the comparable co- hort of

of ,1 year. discussion this report describes changes in the life expectancy of the pittsburgh edc study by year of type 1 diabetes diagnosis (1950 –1964 vs. 1965 –1980). crude survival was signi ﬁ- cantly higher in the more recent (1965 –1980) diagnosis subcohort, as previously reported (6), and likewise, life expectancy at birth is now shown to have signi ﬁcantly increased by ;15 years compared with the 1950 –1964 subcohort. it should be noted that in the edc study co- hort, age is highly correlated with type 1 diabetes duration (r= 0.85); thus, the observed mortality patterns would be similar if diabetes duration were used as the time scale. the most recent report of life expectancy in type 1 diabetes estimated the life expectancy at birth was 59.7 years in thecanterbury diabetes registry ’s 1984 prevalence database (10), which approximates the 61-year midpoint life expectancy of the two edc subcohorts. the improvement in the edc 1965 –1980 subcohort was apparent in both sexes and persisted regardless of pubertal status at type 1 diabetes diagnosis. in a romanian type 1 diabetes cohort, the mean age at death increased by ;7 years between two similar intervals of diabetes diagnosis (1946 –1965 vs. 1966 –1985), and this improvement also did not differ by sex (22). although absolute mortality, expressed as mortality frequency and incidence density, was higher, the estimated life expectancy in the 1965 –1980 edc subcohort was similar to that of the population-based acr cohort di- agnosed in 1965 –1979. the higher mortality rate, but sim- ilar life expectancy, re ﬂects the somewhat older age of the acr cohort. accounting for the difference in age dis- tribution, survival was similar between the two groups (fig. 1). these results suggest that the hospital-based

diabetes population in mortality in addition to sharing similar epi-demiologic characteristics, as previously described (23). we thus believe the dramatic imp rovement in life expectancy is likely true for the general population with childhood- onset type 1 diabetes and not due to a preferential par- ticipation of healthier individuals in the edc in later years. furthermore, the improvement in life expectancy is far greater than that seen in the general population. there are several potential explanations for the sub- stantial increase in life expectancy between the two sub- cohorts. first, no early childhood deaths were observed in the more recent subcohort (1965 –1980), with the ﬁrst death occurring at age 12 years, compared with the ﬁrst death occurring at age 6 months in the earlier cohort (1950 –1964). the lack of early deaths in the 1965 –1980 subcohort is likely related to the earlier recognition and improved treatment of type 1 diabetes in young children after the 1950s. i ndeed, it has been reported that a large proportion of childhood deaths in type 1 diabetes were attributed to diabetic ketoacidosis or hy- poglycemia (24,25). a second potential explanation for the increase in life expectancy is that there was a general decline in the acute and long-term complications of type 1 diabetes in indi- viduals diagnosed after 1965, because a greater proportion of their diabetes duration occurred during an era of better glucose monitoring and insulin administration (6,26). the greater life expectancy may also be due speci ﬁcally to the reduction of renal disease resulting from improved diabetes care. several reports have demonstrated a decline in renal disease in type 1 diabetes (6,27,28). in addition, an increase in ace inhibitor use within the pittsburgh edc cohort was associated with a decrease in death (29). in fact, the finnish diabetic nephropathy (finndiane) study(30) and the pittsburgh edc study (31) have both recently shown that in the absence of renal disease and micro- albuminuria, the long-term mortality risk in type 1 diabetes is not increased compared with the general population. an increase in statin use is another possible contributor to increasing life expectancy in type 1 diabetes. although his- torically, low rates of statin use in the edc cohort have prevented detailed analysis of the effect of statins on mor- tality rates, the 2008 cholesterol treatment trialists ’collab- orators ’meta-analysis reported a 9% reduction in mortality for each millimole per liter decrease in ldl cholesterol in people with diabetes (type 1 and type 2 combined) (32). this report has several noted strengths. the pittsburgh edc study includes participants who were diagnosed during a 30-year period (1950 –1980), allowing the study cohort to be divided into two subcohorts that likely ex- perienced different natural histories of type 1 diabetes due to improvements in treatment. the edc study has also obtained death certi ﬁcates for all individuals, including those who were eligible to participate but died before the baseline examination, thus minimizing potential survival bias. similarly, 130 individuals who were eligible, but de- clined examination, have provided survey and mortality follow-up. in addition, we were able to validate the life- expectancy estimates for the 1965 –1980 subcohort by us- ing the population-based acr data collected during the same time period, which also had a very high 95% vital status ascertainment. it could be argued that it is not ap- propriate to include the 271 participants who are common to both the edc 1965 –1980 diagnosis subcohort and the acr in this validation. however, if the rates of acr are thegold standard, and they are as a true population-based cohort, then the similarity with edc is an important vali-dation regardless of the amount of overlap. this validation is not of methodology, but rather of whether the estimated rates seen in the hospital-based edc are representative of the local type 1 diabetes population. because the over- lapping segment of edc is itself part of the population, a bias would be created if these individuals were excluded from the acr for this comparison. a key limitation to these analyses is that complete life- time follow-up is not possible for currently surviving par- ticipants because the edc study is ongoing. although we have attempted to correct for this incomplete follow-up byusing chiang ’s maximum likelihood adjustment in our cal- culations of life expectancies, we note that these results are intended as a description of the particular cohort studied and may not be applicable to type 1 diabetes in general, particularly those diagnosed after adolescence. in addition, these ﬁndings may not be fully re ﬂective of the life expec- tancy of a child diagnosed in 2012. although a period or “current ”life-table approach theoretically would address this issue, this is debatable because the “current ”age-speci ﬁc mortality rates that would be used would re ﬂect, at older ages, a survival cohort of those diagnosed before improved care could contribute much to their prognosis. we thus intend for these estimates to be used as relative comparisons of life expectancy between the two sub- cohorts being examined and to describe improvements in mortality and life expectancy over time. the edc is a study of a hospital-based cohort and may not re ﬂect the overall type 1 diabetes population; however, the acr data presented clearly show that life expectancy is similar in the two cohorts, so these data likely present a reasonable estimate of the life expectancy of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes in this area. in conclusion, life expectancy improved from the 1950 – 1964 to 1965 –1980 type 1 diabetes diagnosis subcohorts of the pittsburgh edc study, a hospital-based cohort of childhood-onset type 1 diabetes. a similar improvement between diagnosis subcohorts was observed regardless of sex or pubertal status at diagnosis. further investigation shows this life expectancy is similar to community-based life expectancy, suggesting childhood-onset type 1 diabetes diagnosed in the late 1960s and 1970s is associated with only a 4- to 6-year loss-of-life expectancy compared with .17 years for those diagnosed in the 1950s and early 1960s. these results support the need for insurance companies to update their analysis of the life expectancy of those with childhood-onset type 1 diabetes, because the current weighting of insurance prem iums is based on earlier, outdated estimates. acknowledgments the pittsburgh edc study was supported by a grant fromthe national institute of diabetes and digestive and kid- ney diseases (r01-dk034818), which had no role in the design

diabetologia (1993) 36:329--334 diabetologia 9 springer-verlag 1993 cognitive dysfunction in adults with type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus of long duration: effects of recurrent hypoglycaemia and other chronic complications c. m. ryan 1, t. m. williams1, d. n. finegoid 2 and t. j. orchard 3 i department of psychiatry, university of pittsburgh, school of medicine, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, usa 2 department of pediatrics, university of pittsburgh, school of medicine, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, usa 3 graduate school of public health, university of pittsburgh school of medicine, pittsburgh, pennsylvania, usa summary. to examine the long-term effects of recurrent severe hypoglycaemia and other biomedical complications on mental efficiency, a battery of cognitive tests was adminis- tered to 142 type i (insulin-dependent) diabetic adult pa- tients (age 33.5 +-5.6 years; mean  and 100 demo- graphically similar non-diabetic control subjects. all diabetic subjects had been diagnosed before the age of 17 years. diabetic subjects with one or more complications (distal symmetrical polyneuropathy; advanced background or pro- liferative retinopathy; overt nephropathy; one or more epi- sodes of severe hypoglycaemia) performed significantly (p < 0.001) more poorly than non-diabetic control subjects on tests requiring sustained attention, rapid analysis of visuospatial detail, and hand eye co-ordination. regression analyses indicated that the best biomedical predictor of cog- nitive test performance was a diagnosis of polyneuropathy. although severe recurrent hypoglycaemia was not associ- ated with performance on any test, the neuropathy  recur- rent hypoglycaemia interaction term was significant. these results suggest that in adults with type i diabetes of long du- ration, recurrent hypoglycaemia does not appear to in- fluence cognitive performance directly, but may interact with neuropathy to exaggerate or otherwise magnify the extent of neurobehavioural dysfunction. key words: cognitive impairment, hypoglycaemia, hyper- glycaemia, adults. a single episode of moderate hypoglycaemia can readily produce a transient disruption in cognitive functioning. studies using the insulin-glucose clamp technique have re- peatedly demonstrated that when plasma glucose levels are experimentally reduced below 2.8 mmol/1, both diabetic [1-4] and non-diabetic [2, 5-8] subjects often show a marked decline in mental efficiency. hypogly- caemic-induced neurobehavioural deficits occur most fre- quently on tasks requiring sustained attention [4, 7], rapid decision making [1, 2, 7, 8], analysis of complex visual stimuli [5, 7], "mental l~[exibility" [3-5, 7], memory for re- cently learned information [3, 7], and hand eye co-ordina- tion [4, 6, 7]. cognitive changes that accompany a single episode of experimentally-induced hypoglycaemia are usually con- sidered to be innocuous because neurobehavioural test performance returns to pre-hypoglycaemic baseline lev- els following restoration of the euglycaemic state. never- theless, each episode is necessarily associated with a series of changes in cerebral metabolism [9], including excessive release of excitotoxins such as glutamate [10]. although the excitotoxic hypothesis of neuronal necrosis is based upon animal studies in which a single episode of very severe hypoglycaemia is maintained for at least 30 min [11], it is not inconceivable that repeated episodes of moderate hypoglycaemia would, over time, have a cumu- lative effect that leads to significant neuronal damage in humans. if so, one would expect to find evidence of im- pairment on a wide range of neurobehavioural measures. results from two recent cross-sectional studies are con- sistent with that prediction. both wredling and co-workers [12] and langan and colleagues [13] found that diabetic adults who had recurrent episodes of severe hypogly- caemia performed worse on cognitive tests than adults with no history of severe hypoglycaemia. on the other hand, reichard et al. [14] failed to find a relationship between hy- poglycaemia and mental efficiency when they examined 5-year follow-up data from a longitudinal study comparing intensive insulin therapy with standard treatment. despite a three-fold increase in the number of episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, subjects in the intensive insulin treatment group did not differ from standard treatment subjects. be- cause the interpretation of this negative study has been questioned by other investigators [15], the relationship be- tween recurrent severe hypoglycaemia and cognitive func- tioning remains controversial [16]. 330 table l demographic characteristics of type 1 diabetic and non- diabetic subjects non- all diabetic no compli- one or diabetic subjects cations more com- subjects plications age(years) 34.1_+ 6.7 33.5.+ 5.6 30.7.+ 5.6 34.4+ 5.4 years of education 14.2_+ 2.2 14.3+ 2.5 14.6_+ 2.9 14.3_+ 2.4 hollingshead ses 37.1+11.7 39.i.+12.3 40.9.+13.9 38.5_+11.9 wais-r verbaliq 101.9+ 9.7 98.6.+ 10.7 96.6_+ 12.0 99.0_+ 10.3 proportion of males (%) 47 51 55 49 proportion of blacks (%) 5 1 3 1 values are means+sd. ses, socioeconomic status; wais-r, wechsler adult intelligence scale, revised table 2. biomedical characteristics of type 1 diabeticsubjects all diabetic no complica- one or more subjects tions complications n 142 29 113 age (years) 33.5 _+ 5.6 30.7 .+ 5.6 34.3 + 5.4 b age at onset (years) 8.7 .+ 4.2 10.2 +_ 3.4 8.3 .+ 4.3 a duration of diabetes (years) 24.8 + 6.1 20.5 + 5.8 25.9 + 5.6 ~ hbai (%) 10.6 +_ 1.8 10.7 _+ 1.9 10.6 .+ 1.7 blood glucose at testing (mmol/1) 11.1+5.4 11.8_+5.1 10.9+5.6 clinical neuropathy score (%) none or possible 59 100 49 c definite 4l 0 52 retinopathy score (%) none or background 39 100 23 c advanced background 20 0 25 proliferative 41 0 51 severe hypoglycaemia (%) no 66 100 57 c yes 34 0 43 age, duration of diabetes, age at onset, and hba1 values are given as mean+sd. "p <0.05; bp <0.01; ~ <0.001 vs subjects with no complications our cross-sectional study was undertaken to examine the interactive effects of repeated hypoglycaemia and other diabetic complications on mental efficiency. to that end, cognitive tests known to be sensitive to hypogly- caemia were included in the assessment battery. all are identical, or analogous, to those used previously in insulin- glucose clamp studies. furthermore, because of the well- known relationship between duration of diabetes and de- velopment of complications [17], type 1 diabetic adult c.m. ryan et al.: cognitive dysfunction associated with complications patients were recruited from a large cohort of subjects who had developed the disease in childhood. finally, in order to examine the relationship between diabetes and cognitive functioning, a comparison group of demo- graphically similar non-diabetic control subjects was also evaluated. subjects and methods subjects diabetic subjects were randomly selected from the pittsburgh epi- demiology of diabetic complications (edc) study population [18]. edc subjects are drawn from the children's hospital of pittsburgh (chp) insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus registry which is a well-defined childhood onset (less than 17 years old) cohort of type i diabetic individuals who were diagnosed or seen within 1 year of diagnosis at chp between 1950 and 1980. the chp regis- try is considered to be representative of childhood diabetes in alleg- heny county. non-diabetic subjects were recruited by asking each diabetic subject to name a spouse, sibling, "significant other", or close friend. approximately two-thirds of the control subjects were unrelated; the remainder were spouses. written informed consent was obtained from all subjects. the protocol had been reviewed and approved by the university of pittsburgh institutional review board. all subjects were paid for their participation. this paper de- scribes results from 142 diabetic and 100 non-diabetic subjects, all of whom were between the ages of 18 and 49 years (mean  33.8.+ 6.1). the numbers of males and females in each group were similar. demographic characteristics are summarized in table l. both groups had completed some college or post-secondary educa- tion, and their wais-r verbal iq scores were in the "average" range. there are no statistically significant between-group differ- ences on any variable. biomedical measures at the time of cognitive assessment, the ambient blood glucose level of diabetic subjects was measured with an ames glucometer (elk- hart, ind., usa). if the level was less than 4.5 mmol/1, a snack was consumed before testing. edc staff conducted all other biomedical evaluations, and the technicians administered the cognitive tests without prior knowledge of the edc results. distal symmetric polyneuropathy (dsp) was determined with the diabetes control and complications trial (dcct) protocol clinical examination [19]. a dichotomous scale was used. dsp was considered "definitely present" if two of the following three criteria were met and could not be attributed to a non-diabetic cause: (1) symptoms consistent with dsp; (2) decreased or absent tendon re- flexes; (3) signs of sensory loss. retinopathy was determined with three field (designations 1, 2, and 4) stereoscopic fundus photography taken by a zeiss camera and read by the university of wisconsin-madison fundus photography reading center. readings were classified into four categories ac- cording to the modified airlie house system [20]: (1) no retinopathy (grade 10 in both eyes); (2) early background (highest grade 20 or 30 in either eye); (3) advanced background (highest grade 40 or 50); (4) proliferative (grade 60 or higher in at least one eye, or a grade less than 60 but with panretinal pbotocoagulation scars consistent with laser therapy). in our analyses, the "no retinopathy" and "early background" categories were collapsed into a single category be- cause no retinopathy was such a rare event in the complications sub- ~oup (n = 1). overt nephropathy was defined as (1) presence of renal failure (serum creatinine > 440 btmol/1; being placed on dialysis; or post- renal transplant), (2) increased albumin excretion rate c.m. ryan et al.: cognitive dysfunction associated with complications table 3. raw scores (mean_+ sd) from neuropsychological tests and 95 % confidence intervals for non-diabetic and type i diabetic subjects non-diabetic all diabetic no compli- one or more controls subjects cations complications digit vigilance 363.7 _+ 77.9 400.7 _+ 98.1 378.6_+ 87.7 406.4 +_ 100.2 a time 348.2-379.2 384.5-417.0 345.2-411.9 387.8~425.1 embedded 7.4 _+ 2.7 9.2 + 4.6 7.9 + 2.9 b 9.5 + 4.9 ~ figures time 6.9-7.9 8.5-9.9 6.8-9.0 8.6-10.5 trail making - 54.3 _+ 18.2 58.3  22.3 59.9 _+ 24.8 57.8 _+ 21.6 part b 50.7-57.9 54.6-61.9 50.4-69.4 53.8-61.9 grooved 64.2  9.4 76.1 + 16.1 66.3  8.7 b 78.6  16.@ pegboard 62.3-66.0 73.4-78.7 63.0-69.6 75.5-81.7 story forget- 21.5  16.3 22.5 + 15.1 19.7 +_ 11.8 23.3  15.9 ring score 18.2-24.7 19.9-25.0 15.2-22.2 20.3-26.2 high scores reflect poorer performance. tukey post-hoc contrasts: ~p <0.05 non-diabetic control subjects vs diabetic subjects with complications;

bio-rad, hercules, calif., usa). severe hypoglycaemia was ascertained by means of a structured interview. subjects were asked if they have "ever had an episode of hypoglycaemia so severe that you sought medical help (emergency room; doctor)?" if yes, further questions about loss of consciousness and seizures were asked. subjects were then asked to estimate the total number of such episodes they had experienced, and were asked to provide details of each. whenever possible, estimates were cor- roborated by another family member, and by review of medical rec- ords. the resulting frequency distribution from the 48 subjects re- porting one or more severe hypoglycaemic events was categorized into septiles, having median values of 1, 2, 4, 10, 15, 50, and 150 life- time hypoglycaemic episodes, respectively. subsequent regression analyses used categorical septile scores (values 0 for none, and 1-7). age at onset was dichotomized into "early" (diagnosis at or be- fore 5 years of age) or "later" (after age 5) based on previous re- search [21, 22]. diabetic subjects were stratified into two groups: those without complications, and those with one or more complications. subjects were assigned to the no complications subgroup if they met all of the following four criteria: (1) no dsp; (2) no advanced background or proliferative retinopathy in either eye; (3) no overt nephropathy; and (4) no previous episodes of severe hypoglycaemia. twenty-nine subjects had no complications; 113 had one or more complications. 331 biomedical characteristics are summarized in table 2 for the entire diabetic group, and for each of the two subgroups. cognitive measures general intelligence was estimated from the verbal iq score derived from the six verbal subtests comprising the wais-r [23]. the remaining cognitive tests are identical, or analogous, to tasks used by us in hyperinsulinaemic clamp studies of adults [7]. the digit vigilance test provides a measure of sustained atten- tion. subjects are presented with two pages of numbers and told to cross out all sixes as quickly as possible. the response measure is total time (in seconds) to complete the task [24]. the embedded figures test provides a measure of visual scan- ning and rapid decision making. on each of ten trials, subjects see a card with a geometric design (target) in the upper half and four com- plex patterns in the lower half. their task is to identify the pattern with the target. the response measure is mean latency to correct identification [25]. the trail making test (part b) yields an estimate of"mental flex- ibility". subjects are presented with a page of numbers and letters and are told to draw a line that alternates sequentially between the two (1-a-2-b, etc.). total time to complete the task is the response measure [26]. the grooved pegboard test [27] assesses hand eye co-ordina- tion. subjects are required to place 25 key-shaped pegs into a form- board as quickly as possible. the time to complete the task with the dominant hand is the response measure. the logical memory subtest from the wechsler memory scale [28] provides a measure of memory over a brief delay. a short story is read to the subject, who tells it back immediately after hearing it. thirty minutes later the subject is asked to recall the story again. the response measure is the percent forgotten. statistical analysis non-parametric procedures were used to determine the association between severity of hypoglycaemia and severity of other biomedical complications. analysis of variance techniques were used to com- pare the cognitive test scores of the non-diabetic controls with the diabetic subjects. to test the hypothesis that only diabetic subjects with one or more complications manifest significant cognitive im- pairment, a two-step analytic procedure was used. control subjects were first compared with all diabetic subjects on each of five tests. if the omnibus ffor that measure was significant, the tukey "honestly significant difference" post-hoc procedure was used to compare the three groups. within the diabetic sample, the association between biomedical variables and cognitive test scores was evaluated with multiple regression procedures. all analyses were run with the spss-pc + v3.0 statistical package [29]. table 4. results from hierarchical regression analysis of cognitive test scores digit vigilance embedded figures pegboard r 2 p r 2 p r 2 p trail making memory r 2 p r 2 p demographic 0.106 a 0.001 0.089 a 0.001 0.129 ~ dsp 0.062" 0.002 0.046 a 0.007 0.087 a retinopathy 0.017 0.255 0.016 0.266 0.039 ~ hba1 0.000 0.942 0.000 0.944 0.027" hypo 0.005 0.353 0.011 0.178 0.000 hypo  dsp 0.000 0.971 0.023" 0.050 0.000 total r 2 0.168" 0.000 0.177" 0.000 0.287" 0.000 0.1132 0.001 0.054 ~ 0.050 0.000 0.027 ~ 0.042 0.023 0.069 0.034 0.001 0.926 0.013 0.390 0.028 0.007 0.286 0.000 0.771 0.835 0.005 0.370 0.002 0.538 0.847 0.039 a 0.013 0.001 0.721 0.000 0.154 a 0.003 0.154 a 0.044 r 2 indicates total amount of variance attributed to each specific pre- dictor variable;

diabetic subjects: 5.6; f(1,240) < 1), but diabetic subjects took significantly longer (f(1,240)= 9.87; p < 0.002) to complete the task than control subjects. both groups earned identical ac- curacy scores on the embedded figures test (8.6 items; f< 1), but the diabetic subjects required significantly more time (f(1,240) = 11.69; p < 0.001) to identify each target accurately. very large between-group differences were also evident on the grooved pegboard test (f(1,240) = 44.14; p < 0.0001). diabetic subjects were ap- proximately 19 % slower than control subjects. they re- quired, on average, an additional 12 s to insert 25 pegs into the pegboard with their dominant hand. in contrast, there were no statistically reliable differences on the trail mak- ing test (f(1,240) = 2.2;p = 0.14) or on the logical mem- ory forgetting score (f< 1; ns). in the next series of analyses, tukey post-hoc compari- sons were conducted for those three cognitive measures scores that had initially discriminated between diabetic and non-diabetic subjects. to test the hypothesis that bio- medical complications were associated with cognitive dys- function, data from 29 subjects with no complications were compared with data from 113 having one or more complications. inspection of table 2 indicates that those subjects with no complications were significantly younger (t = 3.18; p = 0.003), developed diabetes at a significantly later age (t = 2.5; p = 0.015), and had diabetes for a signifi- cantly shorter period of time (t = 4.64; p = 0.0001). con- trasts between non-diabetic control subjects and the no complications subgroup indicated that the two groups performed comparably on all cognitive tests (allp > 0.20). that result did not change when age was co-varied. by contrast, the diabetic subjects with complications were significantly impaired (p < 0.05), relative to non-diabetic controls, on the digit vigilance test, the embedded figures test, and on the grooved pegboard test. diabetic subjects with complications were also more impaired (p<0.05) than those without complications on the grooved pegboard and the embedded figures test. to determine the unique and synergistic contributions of specific biomedical complications to cognitive dysfunc- tion, hierarchical multiple regression techniques were ap- plied to the entire diabetic sample of 142 subjects. for each cognitive test score, an eight-step procedure was em- ployed. demographic variables (age, years of education, gender) were entered first to control for the possible ef- fects of those variables on cognitive functioning. the presence or absence of dsp was entered on step 2, be- cause previous work had demonstrated that peripheral neuropathy may be associated with brain dysfunction, as c.m. ryan et al.: cognitive dysfunction associated with complications indexed by neuropsychological [30], neurophysiological [31], and neuroradiological [31] measures. level of retino- pathy (none or background; advanced background; prolif- erative) was entered on step 3. this variable was included because all but one of the cognitive tests have a visual component that could be influenced by visual acuity diffi- culties. although dsp and degree of retinopathy are in- tercorrelated to some extent, the relatively small correla- tion coefficient (r=0.39) did not meet criteria for multicollinearity [32]. nephropathy (overt; none or inci- pient) were entered on step 4 and hba1 (coded as a con- tinuous variable) was entered on step 5 to determine the relationship between performance and other markers of hyperglycaemia. severe hypoglycaemia was entered on step 6. this was coded as a categorical variable that ranged from 0 to 7. age at onset, coded dichotomously as early (before 5 years of age) or later, was entered on step 7. a series of interaction terms (hypoglycaemia x dsp; hypo- glycaemia  retinopathy; retinopathy x dsp)was en- tered on the last step, to determine if hypoglycaemic epi- sodes served to moderate or exaggerate the effects of other complications on cognitive test scores [33]. results from the regression analyses are summarized in table 4. after controlling for demographic variables, a diagnosis of dsp was consistently the best predictor of performance on all measures, except memory (which was not associated with any biomedical predictor). adding the retinopathy score to the model accounted for a small, but statistically significant, amount of additional variance; this was limited to performance on the grooved pegboard test. overt nephropathy was not associated with cog- nitive test scores, whereas hba~ was a weak predictor (r 2--- 0.028) on only one measure - grooved pegboard. remarkably, previous episodes of hypoglycaemia had no impact on any cognitive test scores. on the other hand, significant interaction effects between hypoglycaemia and dsp were found on both the trail making test, and on the embedded figures test. no other biomedical vari- ables or interaction terms were statistically significant. the total amount of variance (total r 2) accounted for by all of the variables (biomedical; interaction terms; demo- graphic) ranged from 6% (memory) to 29% (grooved pegboard). discussion previous studies have suggested that cognitive impairment may be a common, but generally unrecognized, complica- tion of type 1 diabetes [34-39]. our results are consistent with that view. as a group, adults who developed type 1 diabetes in childhood or adolescence performed more poorly than age- and education-matched non-diabetic subjects on a variety of cognitive tests. our results also sug- gest that the primary predictor of neurobehavioural dys- function is not having diabetes per se, but having developed clinically significant diabetic complications. we found that adults with no biomedical complications earned scores that were indistinguishable from healthy control subjects. in contrast, those who had one or more complications per- formed significantly worse than controls and diabetic sub- jects without complications - especially on tasks that re- c.m. ryan et ai.: cognitive dysfunction associated with complications quired sustained attention, rapid analysis of visuospatial detail, and hand eye co-ordination. an examination of the relationship between specific complications and cognitive test scores provided no evi- dence of a direct effect of recurrent hypoglycaemia on performance, despite the fact that previous studies had demonstrated that these particular cognitive tests are sen- sitive to acute hypoglycaemia. furthermore, retinopathy was not a potent predictor of performance, even though all of the tests that discriminated diabetic from non- diabetic subjects had a visual component. of the biomedi- cal variables examined, the best predictor was distal sym- metrical polyneuropathy. diabetic subjects who met criteria for dsp performed worse on all tasks, except memory (which was not influenced by any variable). the relationship between dsp and test scores could not be at- tributed to peripheral sensory or motor problems, be- cause performance on tasks having no kinesthetic or mo- toric requirements, like the embedded figures test, was also most strongly associated with dsp score. although cognitive performance was not directly in- fluenced by recurrent hypoglycaemia alone, it was in- fluenced by the interaction between recurrent hypogly- caemia and dse that is, the hypoglycaemia x dsp interaction term accounted for a small but statistically sig- nificant amount of variance on both the embedded figures test and the trail making test. no other interac- tion term predicted performance. discussions of the aetiology of diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunction have generally emphasized the role of hypoglycaemia, and not hyperglycaemia. certainly, an acute episode of hypoglycaemia is far more likely to pro- duce a dramatic (albeit transient) deterioration in mental efficiency than is an acute episode of hyperglycaemia [2, 4, 40]. moreover, clinical case reports have indicated that a single episode of severe hypoglycaemia may produce a variety of transient or permanent neurological disorders including hemiplegia [41], amnesia [42], and coma [43], while neuropathological studies have demonstrated the presence of hypoglycaemic-associated neuronal necrosis in the cortex, hippocampus, and basal ganglia of humans [43, 44] and animals [45, 46]. this focus on hypoglycaemia has led many clinicians to ignore the possibility that cog- nitive dysfunction may also be associated with chronic hyperglycaemia. nevertheless, there is increasing evi- dence to suggest that chronic hyperglycaemia and its bio- medical complications may trigger, or be associated with, significant brain dysfunction. the most consistent neurobehavioural evidence for a relationship between hyperglycaemia and cognitive im- pairment comes from studies of elderly type 2 (non-in- sulin-dependent) diabetic adult patients. performance on a wide variety of cognitive tests is correlated with glycosyl- ated haemoglobin levels: the poorer the degree of metabo- lic control, the greater the level of impairment. this is most apparent on learning and memory tests [34, 47-49], but has also been reported on tests of attention and concept forma- tion [50]. research with younger type i diabetic adult sub- jects has produced less consistent results. some investiga- tors [51] have reported no relationship between neuropsychological test performance and the presence of 333 hyperglycaemic complications like neuropathy, while others, including our group [30], have noted such an associ- ation, particularly on psychomotor tasks. on the other hand, neurophysiological [52-55] and neuroimaging studies [31] have demonstrated that diabetic adults with a history of poor metabolic control have clear evidence of brain dysfunction. this has been demonstrated most con- vincingly by dejgaard et al. [31], who studied 20 middle- aged diabetic adults, all of whom had evidence of periph- eral neuropathy. abnormal brain stem auditory evoked potentials were found in 40 % of these subjects, and abnor- mal magnetic resonance imaging results (characterized as lesions 2-10 mm in size) were found in 69 % of the diabetic subjects. taken together, these studies suggest that chronic hyperglycaemia may be associated with the development of a "central neuropathy". there is no doubt that a severe episode of hypogly- caemia may result in significant brain dysfunction. by the same token, chronic hyperglycaemia - as indexed by ele- vated glycosylated haemoglobin values or the presence of complications such as neuropathy, may also result in brain dysfunction. in an earlier discussion of the possible inter- active effects of hypo- and hyperglycaemia on microvas- cular disease, frier and hilsted [56] suggested that hypo- glycaemia may aggravate the complications of diabetes. results from the present study are consistent with that view. although the exact mechanism remains obscure, it appears that hypoglycaemia aggravates the neurobe- havioural complications that are associated with long- term diabetes. acknowledgements. this work was supported by national institutes of health grants dk-39629 and dk-34818. references 1. holmes cs, hayford jt, gonzales jl, weydert ja (1983) a sur- vey of cognitive functioning at different glucose levels in diabetic persons. diabetes care 6:180-185 2. herold kc, polonsky ks, cohen rm, levy j, douglas f (1985) variable deterioration in cortical function during insulin-in- duced hypoglycemia. diabetes 34:677-685 3. pramming s, thorsteinsson b, theilgaard a, pinner em, binder c (1986) cognitive function during hypoglycaemia in type i diabetes mellitus. br med j 292:647q550 4. hoffman rg, speelman dj, hinnen da, conley kl, guthrie ra, knapp rk (1989) changes in cortical functioning with acute hypoglycemia and hyperglycemia in type i diabetes. diabetes care 3:193-197 5. widom b, simonson dc (1990) glycemic control and neuropsy- chologic function during hypoglycemia in patients with insulin- dependent diabetes mellitus. ann intern med 112:904-912 6. stevens ab, mckane wr, bell pm, bell r king d j, hayes jr (1989) psychomotor performance and counterregulatory re- sponses during mild hypoglycemia in healthy volunteers. diabetes care 12:12-17 7. mitrakou a, ryan c, veneman t et al.

diabetologia (1990) 33:152-157 diabetologia 9 springer-verlag 1990 permanent neuropsychological impairment after recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycaemia in man r. wredling 1 , s. levander 2, u. adamson 1 and r e. lins 1 1 department of medicine, danderyd hospital, sweden, and 2 institute of psychiatry, ostmarka hospital, trondheim, norway summary. seventeen type i (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients with a history of recurrent and severe hypogly- caemia and type 1 diabetic patients with no severe hypogly- caemia were compared as regarded performances in tests of neuropsychological functioning. to test the hypothesis that recurrent severe hypoglycaemia gives rise to permanent cog- nitive impairment, the study group was selected among those patients who had met with repeated attacks over the last three years or more as identified by a questionnaire among almost 600 insulin-treated diabetic patients. the comparison group without known severe reactions were comparable to the study group with respect to type of diabetes, sex, age, age at onset, duration of diabetes, socio-economic parameters, and prevalence of neuropathy and retinopathy. the results indicate that type i diabetic patients with recurrent severe hypoglycaemia scored lower than those without severe hypo- glycaemia in tests of motor ability, short-term and associative memory and visuospatial tasks assessing ability in general problem-solving. type 1 diabetic patients with severe hypo- glycaemia also displayed a higher frequency of perspective reversals suggesting frontal-lobe involvement. these data can be interpreted in two ways. one interpretation implies that the cognitive impairment of type i diabetic patients with severe hypoglycaemia reflects a selection factor, the other that recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycaemia result in permanent cognitive impairment. key words: severe hypoglycaemia, cognitive function and hypoglycaemia, type i (insulin-dependent) diabetes melli- tus. patients with type i (insulin-dependent) diabetes melli- tus always run the risk of suffering hypoglycaemic epi- sodes, a fact which has become more and more evident over the last decade, as systematic monitoring of blood glucose has revealed unexpectedly high frequencies of hy- poglycaemia [1-3]. hypoglycaemia influences brain func- tion due to the inability of the brain to utilize oxygen at low blood glucose levels, in spite of normal arterial oxygen tension [4], which may result in brain damage. in clinical medicine such damage may be evident in the form of eeg abnormalities [5-8], mild dementia [9] and permanent neurologic sequelae [5, 10]. children seem to be particu- larly vulnerable in this respect and youngsters who have had episodes of severe hypoglycaemia before the age of five show neuropsychological or eeg abnormalities with high frequency [11-13]. the majority of reports relating brain dysfunction to hypoglycaemia concern type 1 diabetic children. so far, only a few studies have examined the relationship between hypoglycaemic episodes and brain function in adult type 1 diabetic patients [9, 14]. these studies show that patients with a case history of severe hypoglycaemia perform more poorly than others in visuo-motor-coordination tests and that they display a lower iq. furthermore, some patients show mild demen- tia. the present study was focussed on a subgroup of adult type i diabetic patients with recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycaemia selected from a large group of insulin- treated diabetic patients. our aim was to evaluate the ap- plicability of a battery of computerized neuropsychologi- cal tests in the present context, and to analyse whether recurrent severe hypoglycaemia could give rise to perma- nent cognitive impairment. subjects and methods during 1985, insulin-treated type i and type 2 diabetic patients at- tending our out-patient clinic were asked to complete a question- naire covering the frequency and symptoms of hypoglycaemia dur- ing the preceding 12 months. in particular, they were questioned about episodes of hypoglycaemia in which external help was re- r. wredling et

(18%) reported at least one severe hypoglycemic episode, defined as an event with unconsciousness and need for external help. a detailed analysis revealed that twenty of those 98 patients had met with repeated attacks over the last three years or more without any obvious reason. three patients were not further investigated; one 78-year-old female patient died during the investigation due to end- stage, diabetic nephropathy and two were excluded because of high age and poor general condition. the remaining 17 patients (8 males, 9 females) having met with recurrent severe hypoglycaemia (sh) formed the study group. all were c-peptide negative and considered as type 1 diabetic patients. for comparison a group of 17 patients was selected by matching, in order of priority, type of diabetes, sex, age and duration of diabetes from among the remaining 435 patients who, in the above questionnaire, did not report any episodes of severe hypoglycaemia (no-sh). the two groups were comparable with respect to sex, age, age at onset, duration of diabetes, injection frequency, insulin dose and hbalc (normal values below 5.6%). the prevalence of neuropathy and retinopathy was also similar in the two groups (table 1). one patient in the no-sh group had poor visual acuity due to proliferative retinopathy (visus 0.2 on the best eye) but had no difficulty participating in the test. only a limited number of the patients were using tranquilizers, thus, among the patients with sh, one was treated with nortriptylinchloride due to depression, an- other patient, suffering from insomnia, was regularly taking alime- mazine and a third patient was taking hydroxizinchloride because of chronic allergic urticaria. in the no-sh group two patients were regularly taking nitrazepam due to insomnia. when asked to participate in the study, all patients accepted. the study was approved by the local ethics committee and all consent- ing persons signed an informed consent form. patients were in- structed beforehand to keep their regular lifestyle and to monitor blood glucose during the 24 h prior to the test. the test was post- poned if hypoglycaemia, i. e. blood glucose below 3 retool/l, occurred within that period. if the blood glucose level was between 3-6 mmol/1 the patients were instructed to eat extra food. in connection with the test session a personal interview about socio-economic factors was performed by using a standardized ques- tionnaire. the employment status was studied by means of a modi- fied version of the american quality of employment survey [15]. the employment category included those who were currently em- ployed full time or part time; the not professional practising included retired persons, housewives and students. the patients alcohol con- sumption was divided into five levels according to a classification based on a tentative risk evaluation scale [16]. the neuropsychological examinations were performed at about 10.00hours under out-patient conditions. blood glucose was measured immediately before and after the neuropsychological test session. 153 computerized neuropsychological tasks cognitive functions were assessed by the automated psychological test system [17]. the time required for a test session of eight sepa- rate tests was approximately 60 min, including instructions. each subject participated in two identical test sessions. only data from the second session are presented. the following tests were adminis- tered. the finger tapping test, assessing the motor ability, comprising five subtests: (1) right index-finger tapping, (2) left index-finger tap- ping, (3)right index/middle-finger alternation, (4)left index/ middle-finger alternation and (5) right/left index-finger alternation. the results are given as the number of tappings/alternations per sec- ond. the reaction time (rt) test, comprising four subtasks: (a) simple auditory rt: 10 auditory stimuli of 1000 hz, at approximately 65 de- cibel, (b) simple visual rt: 10 light stimuli, size 22 x 22 ram, in the center of the monitor screen, superimposed on a constantly dis- played, central fixation cross, (c) two-choice (left-right) visual rt: 10 stimuli to the right of the center of the screen and 10 to the left in random balanced order, distanced 80 mm from the central fixation cross, and(d) two-choice visual stimuli with auditory signals for re- sponse inhibition: 20 visual stimuli, presented either to the right or to the left of the center of the screen, in random balanced order. eleven of these visual stimuli were paired with a concomitant auditory sig- nal. such "double" stimuli were to be neglected. the following pa- rameters were calculated (a) mean reaction time (ms) for each sub- task, separately for left-sided and right-sided stimuli in subtasks c and d, (b) number of correct responses to left-vs right-sided stimuli in subtask c, and (c) number of failed inhibitions of responses in subtask d. the trail-making test, assessing visuo-motor-coordination, v&ual search and eye-hand coordination: the subjects were to hit digits and letters in serial order by means of a joy-stick monitored cursor. the test included three parts: (1) a training session, during which the test and its solution were demonstrated twice on letters j to o; (2) a ses- sion with two form a subtests (digits only, from 1 to 9) and one form b subtest (digits and letters in combination from 1 a to 9j) for the preferred hand; and (3) an identical session for the non- preferred hand. the scores used were means of individual hit times for the two form a subtests (18 hits) and means of the form b sub- test (18 hits) for the preferred and the non-preferred hand. in addi- tion, instances of failure to follow the sequence was assessed by a "navigation" parameter. the necker cube test, assessing the frequency of passively perceived perspective reversals, assumed to reflect frontal-lobe functions: be- fore the test started, the figure-reversal phenomenon was explained to the subjects and demonstrated by an outline of a necker cube drawn on a card. the subjects were instructed to look steadily at a central fixation point in the middle of the cube and to press a button each time the cube changed in perspective. the necker cube (15 x 15 cm) was presented for 90 s. the scores were the numbers of perceived reversals, the median time interval between perceived reversals, and the time from the presentation of the cube until the first perceived reversal. the digit span test, reflecting short-term memory and concentration: the subjects were to memorize a series of digits, showing up like blips on the screen and then to reproduce them on the keyboard. in the first part this was to be done in shown order, in the second part in reverse order. the level of difficulty, i.e. the number of digits presented, was process-controlled; for each correctly reproduced item, the next contained one more digit and for each incorrectly re- produced item, the next contained one less digit. the forward task, starting with three digits, included 13 series. the backward task, starting with two digits, included 10 series. the scores were (a) the 154 maximum number of digits forward, (b) the median of the last three series of digits forward, and corresponding data for digits backward. the digit-symbol test, reflecting motor speed, visual search and asso- ciative learning: sets of letter/digit combinations were shown on a translation board on the upper part of the screen. then single letters were shown and the subjects were to mark corresponding digits on the keyboard. the number of sets increased stepwise from two over fivetoten.totalmonitoringtimewas5 min. the scores were (a) the mean response time in phases 1, 2 and 3, and (b) the number of er- rors in phases 1, 2 and 3. the maze test, a rather complex, visuo-spatial task reflecting factors of general intelligence, visuo-spatial skill, motor speed, and strategy and laterality factors [18, 19]: maze patterns were presented on the monitor. the task of the subjects were to complete a pathway through the maze as fast as possible, passing as many targets as possible. the path through the maze was selected by operating a set of four buttons on the keyboard. the number of targets required for a correct solution might be presented with the maze pattern (with target information) or this information could be omitted (no target information). after an introductory maze session, the subjects were given a total of 16 mazes to solve, eight with target information and eight with no target information. the following parameters, based on skill and strategy aspects [20], were calculated for each maze: processing rate (nodes per s), inspection rate (time in s from presen- tation of maze until first key press, divided by number of nodes of maze), check time (time after completing the pathway until pressing the confirm button), left/right preference (arbitrary units for pref- erence for left-vs right-sided solutions), motor time (typical time for the most rapid key-pressing in ms), number of correctly solved mazes, largest maze pattern solved correctly, and number of rub- outs. medians were calculated over the eight mazes within the two conditions (target information and no target information). inspec- tion time, check time and number of rub-outs were interpreted as strategy indices. left/right preference was used as a laterality par- ameter. processing rate, motor time and number of correctly solved mazes were skill parameters. finally, the contrast between process- ing speed and number of correctly solved mazes is a strategy par- ameter. the digit-symbol memory test assessing associative memory: this test is identical to the digit-symbol test, but without the translation list and with duration time 3 rain only. subjects were instructed to re- spond within 6 s to letter stimuli according to what they remembered of the translation list and encouraged to guess when uncertain. the scores were (a) mean response time and (b) number of correct vs incorrect responses. statistical analysis the results were analysed mainly by student's t-test and the wil- coxon paired-rank sum test when applicable. to assess differences in alcohol intake the mann-whitney sum rank test was used. prob- abilities belowp < 0.05 were regarded as statistically significant. un- less otherwise stated, the data are presented as mean _+ sd. results the mean blood glucose concentrations before and after the neuropsychological testing were 10.7 + 4.9 mmol/1 (range 3.5-19.6) and 13.2 + 3.5 mmol/1 (range 7.7-19.3) in type i patients with sh, and 10.1 _+ 5.4 mmol/1 (range 4.4-21.3) and 9.9 + 5.7 mmol/1

education, employment status and level of exertion. no significant difference in alcohol consumption between the groups was found (23.5  22.4 vs 62.3 + 89.7 g alcohol/week). however, the tendency in the sh group was toward a greater number of teetotallers. also in this group no pa- tient was consuming more than the average intake of alco- hol among swedish adult inhabitants, 96 g alcohol/week [21]. the neuropsychological test scores are given in table 3. data from the finger tapping test, assessing the motor ability, showed significantly slower tapping in alter- nation right (t = 2.17,p <

among type 1 diabetic patients with sh (t = 2.06,p < 0.05). short-term memory and concentration, as assessed by the digit span test, showed that type 1 diabetic patients with sh were not able to repeat as many number of digits forward as type 1 diabetic patients with no-sh (t = 2.06, p < 0.05). associative memory, as assessed by the digit- symbol test, showed that type 1 diabetic sh patients re- sponded slower in the task of translating letters into digits, when the translation list comprised five letters (2493 vs 2186 ms, t = 2.12, p < 0.05). there was also a trend to- wards significance in response time when ten letter/digit pairs were presented, type 1 diabetic sh patients re- sponding slower (2832 vs 2545 ms, t = 1.90, p < 0.10). in the digit-symbol memory test, no significant differences between the groups were found. r. wredling et al.: neuropsychological impairment and hypoglycaemia table 3. neuropsychological tests for type i (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients with

time task (2.4 vs 1.7, t = 1.69,p < 0.10). there were no other dif- ferences in the reaction time task between the groups. neither were there any differences for the trail-making test parameters. the most complex test used in our study, the maze test, was applied in order to assess general problem-solving ability. data from this test showed that type 1 diabetic pa- tients with sh had a markedly slower processing rate (t = 3.29, p < 0.001) and needed more time between the solution and the confirmation of each problem (t = 2.29, p < 0.01). type 1 diabetic sh patients also used a more cautious strategy and therefore solved more mazes cor- rectly (t = 2.31, p < 0.05). the performance on the maze test condition without target information showed that type 1 diabetic patients with sh used a more sequential, left-hemisphere-type strategy in the solving process by using fewer rub-outs (0.3 vs 0.7 per maze, t =3.01, p < 0.01). 155 discussion the present study supports the conclusion in the pre- viously cited earlier (1973) study by bale [9] that brain damage is related to the severity of past hypoglycaemic episodes. our study is also in line with previous research by skenazy [14] which found that performance iq corre- lated negatively with the incidence of severe hypogly- caemic reactions. bale assessed cognitive functions by the walton-black new world learning test [22, 23] and the wechsler adult intelligence scale [24]. skenazy, in 1984, also assessed cerebral faculties by the wechsler adult in- telligence scale [24] and in addition by the halstead-rei- tan neuropsychological test battery [25]. in our study we employed a computerized neuropsychological test bat- tery developed in the 1980's [26]. it is well known that the cognitive capacity is reduced acutely by hypoglycaemia, alcohol and many drugs. also the chronic use of alcohol may affect intellectual func- tions. in the present study we had no indication that the diabetic patients with sh were using alcohol or tranquil- izers more extensively, and during the test situation they all had a blood glucose level above the hypoglycaemic range. the difference observed in the cognitive tests be- tween our two groups of type 1 diabetic patients was probably not attributed to late diabetic complications as tests like reaction time, trail-making i.e. tests that re- quired motor strength, motor speed and visual efficiency, were close to identical in the two groups. we also estimate that the reduction in cognitive capacity was acquired dur- ing their life with the disease, as the two groups had the same educational level. three of the neuropsychological methods used in our study are assumed to reflect frontal-lobe functions, on different levels of complexity and integration, the finger tapping, the necker cube and the maze tests. the frontal lobes are concerned with planning, programming and controlling actions [20]. speed of finger alternation, a part of the finger tapping test which measures a moder- ately complex motor act, was significantly impaired in our type i diabetic patients with sh. the necker cube data demonstrated that these patients had a significantly higher number of perspective reversals than those with- out severe hypoglycaemia. according to cohen [27], uni- lateral damage decreases and bilateral damage increases the rate of such reversals, and in a study by yacorzinski and davies it was demonstrated that patients with unilat- eral frontal lobectomy perceived fewer reversals than the control subjects [28]. during acute hypoglycaemia, i.e. blood glucose concentration of between 1.8 and 2.9 mmol/1 executive cognitive functions were profound- ly affected and the frontal-lobe based functions were uni- laterally affected [29]. our necker cube and finger tapping results, thus, suggest that the frontal-lobe dysfunction related to hypoglycaemic episodes is bilat- eral. performance in the maze tasks showed that the type 1 diabetic patients with no-sh were superior to the patients with sh, particularly for mazes with target infor- mation. the maze test was originally designed to assess frontal lobe functions, but empirical studies, as well as a 156 content analysis of the test suggest that factors of visuo- spatial skill, general intelligence and presence of brain lesion have high loadings [18]. our data suggest that type 1 diabetic patients with sh differed from the com- parison group in two ways: they displayed inferior per- formance and they solved the test in a different way. their solution strategy was characterized by a marked preference for accuracy rather than speed, and by doubts and hesitation when acknowledging the solution. such a pattern of slowness and over-control has been associated with lateral rather than orbitomedial frontal lobe lesions [30]. one may speculate on how this particular way of solving a complex psychological test generalizes to problem-solving situations in everyday life. it is not too far fetched to suggest that indecision and anxiety will characterize such patients when confronted with a situ- ation that calls for fast decisions. we have frequently observed that diabetic patients with recurrent severe hypoglycaemia, i.e. despite their knowledge and aware- ness of high-risk situations that might result in hypo- glycaemia, do not take the necessary steps to avoid such situations. type 1 diabetic patients with sh showed slight impair- ments of short-term and associative memory in our study. these findings are in line with those of bale, who showed that patients with sh performed poorly in the tests of auditory learning, including short-term memory [9]. in ad- dition, we found a non-significant tendency towards dete- rioriated memory performances in our hypoglycaemia- prone patients concerning all the memory tasks applied. these memory disturbances may affect the activities of daily life in these patients in a similar manner to that of premature aging. our study shows that type i diabetic patients with sh are cognitively impaired when compared with type 1 diabetic patients with no-sh. the two groups were com- parable with respect to sex, age, age at onset, duration of diabetes, educational level and alcohol consumption, a number of parameters which otherwise would have con- founded the differences. part of the impairment appears to be of the type associated with organic brain damage, and part appears to be related to preference for particular problem solving strategies, but it is impossible to say whether that behaviour is the cause for or the effect of re- current severe hypoglycaemia. since our study is retro- spective, there are two possible interpretations of the as- sociation between hypoglycaemic episodes and cognitive impairment. either there is a causal link, i.e. repeated severe hypoglycaemic episodes cause permanent cogni- tive impairment, or the association reflects some kind of selection procedure or a common underlying factor. this factor should then be associated both with an increased frequency of hypoglycaemia, and with a lower cognitive performance level. the two groups of patients were almost identical in terms of level of education, suggesting that there was probably no great difference in premorbid intellectual level between the groups. compared to healthy control subjects the performance of the two groups of the present study was inferior in many of the tests, and more so for the sh group. this is probably related to age. the corn- r. wredling et al.: neuropsychological impairment and hypoglycaemia parison group which is avaliable has a median age of 35 (range 20 to 50) in contrast to the present one, in which age ranged from 26 to 72 with a median of 49. it is not easy to apply a meaningful comparison at a group level with such a large age span. instead, we used an age- matching paradigm, which is a more effective way to cor- rect for the age factor. in conclusion, since the study is retrospective, the data can be interpreted in two ways. one interpretation implies that the cognitive impairment of adult type i diabetic pa- tients with sh reflects a selection factor, the other that re- current episodes of sh result in permanent cognitive im- pairment. acknowledgements. this work was supported by grants from the stockholm county council, the

summary. to examine the hypothesis that episodes of severe hypogtycaemia may cause cumulative cognitive impairment, 100 type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients were exam- ined. their age range was 25-52 years, and the onset of diabetes had occurred after the age of 19 years. patients with evidence of organic brain disease, including cerebrovascular disease, were excluded. a questionnaire was used to assess the number, frequency and severity of hypoglycaemic epi- sodes experienced during treatment with insulin and the ac- curacy of this retrospective information was verified from general practice and hospital case-notes. a detailed neuro- psychological assessment was undertaken, including tests of pre-morbid and present iq (wechsler-revised), memory and information-processing speed. significant correlations were observed between the frequency of severe hypogly- caemia and the magnitude of intellectual decline, perfor- mance iq, inspection time and reaction time (patients with the more frequent hypoglycaemia had poorer performance). two sub-groups of patients were identified on the basis of their experience of severe hypoglycaemia, and were bal- anced for pre-morbid iq, age and duration of diabetes. one sub-group (n = 23) had never experienced severe hypogly- caemia (group a), whilst the other sub-group (n = 24) had suffered at least five episodes of severe hypoglycaemia (group b). group b had greater intellectual impairment than group a, and group b also had a significantly slower mean reaction time and higher reaction time variance when compared with group a. it is concluded that recurrent severe hypoglycaemia is associated with cumulative cogni- tive impairment in adult diabetic patients treated with in- sulin. key words: hypoglycaemia, insulin, diabetes mellitus, cogni- tive function, intelligence, reaction time, inspection time. the brain is vitally dependent on glucose for its normal function and is neither able to store this substrate in any quantity, nor can it synthesise glucose during acute depri- vation. depletion of the supply of glucose to the brain rapidly causes impaired neuronal function, manifested by acute neuroglycopenia, but it is not known whether this can cause any permanent or cumulative damage, resulting in a decline in intellectual capacity. acute hypoglycaemia is a common side-effect of the treatment of diabetes with insulin, and the intensification of insulin regimens to achieve optimal glycaemic control has increased the risk of hypoglycaemia by 2-3 times [1]. complete clinical re- covery from acute hypoglycaemia is usually rapid and has encouraged the assumption that severe episodic hypogly- caemia does not cause permanent cerebral damage. how- ever, neuropathology studies of diabetic patients with fatal hypoglycaemia have demonstrated widespread areas of damage within the brain [2, 3]. in addition to the direct effect of low blood glucose on neuronal function, it has been suggested that severe hypoglycaemia may precipi- tate acute vascular events [4], and cerebral ischaemia and convulsions both occur during severe hypoglycaemia [5]. prolonged severe hypoglycaemia in animals produces specific damage to the central nervous system, particular- ly when combined with hypoxia [6, 7]. it is possible that repeated exposure to acute hypogly- caemia may cause cumulative damage to the brain which is not clinically evident in the short-term. this may be analogous to the progressive deterioration in intellectual function which is demonstrable following chronic expo- sure to various other insults such as alcohol [8], hypoxia in- duced by sleep apnoea [9], exposure to high altitude [10], or trauma from recurrent head injury [11]. occasionally diabetic patients in clinical practice describe a subjective diminution in intellectual abilities following isolated epi- sodes of severe prolonged hypoglycaemia, but such indi- vidual instances are anecdotal and the degree of impair- ment has rarely been quantified. most research on cognitive function during hypoglycaemia in humans has been confined to an examination of acute and relatively 338 table 1. the clinical characteristics of

effects of neurogly- copenia on cognitive function but provide no evidence for the potentially adverse effects of recurrent hypoglycaemic insults to the brain. however, a small number of studies [17-20] has attempted to ascertain whether hypogly- caemia leaves permanent intellectual impairment. although these studies have some limitations they sug- gest that insulin-treated diabetic patients do suffer mild cognitive damage, the cause of which might be related to severe hypoglycaemia. one method of assessing cognitive impairment is to estimate iq decrement. the present study was undertaken to examine whether repeated exposure to severe hypoglycaemia had affected cognitive functioning in diabetic patients treated with insulin. patients with child- hood onset of diabetes were excluded from the study. a group of adult insulin-treated diabetic patients underwent assessment of cognitive function, using a series of standard psychometric and computerised tests. these patients were carefully screened to exclude factors other than hypogly- caemia which might have affected cognitive function, and evidence of intellectual impairment was examined with re- spect to the estimated frequency and severity of their pre- vious exposure to severe hypoglycaemia. subjects and methods one hundred insulin-treated diabetic patients (57 m, 43 f) were re- cruited at the diabetic department of the royal infirmary of edin- burgh. the age range of the patients was 25 to 52 years (mean 40, sd 6.4). all the patients had type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetes mellitus, the onset of which had occurred after 19 years of age, with a duration of at least 5 years (mean 13, sd 6.2). this age range en- sured that all patients had achieved cognitive maturity before de- veloping diabetes but had not developed significant age-related in- tellectual decline. the minimum duration of diabetes ensured that all patients had been exposed to the risk of insulin-induced hypogly- caemia for at least 5 years, before assessment. all patients who met the strict exclusion criteria were selected. patients were excluded from the study if they had a history of cere- brovascular disease or previous head injury, serious systemic dis- ease, major psychiatric illness, or if they were taking medications which might alter cognitive function, such as psychotropic drugs, beta-adrenergic blockers or steroids. a history of epilepsy or chronic excessive drinking of alcohol were also exclusion factors, as was a visual acuity poorer than 6/9 (which would have interfered with the ability to perform some of the tests of cognitive function). current alcohol consumption was documented by the use of a structured questionnaire which estimated the number of units of alcohol which patients drank per week. excessive drinking was defined using the standard guidelines of the royal college of psychiatrists (uk). all patients were examined to identify the presence of diabetic complications and the co-existence of other medical problems such as hypertension and macrovascular disease. physical examination was performed by an experienced diabetologist, and included direct ophthalmoscopy, biochemical screening and measurement of uri- nary albumin excretion rates on timed overnight urine collections. clinical characteristics of the patients are shown in tabte 1. none of the patients had clinical evidence of macrovascular disease, although some had microangiopathy. no distinction was made between back- ground and (treated) proliferative retinopathy. written informed consent and ethical committee approval was obtained prior to the study being carried out. table 2. the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia within the group of 100 type 1 (insulin-dependent) diabetic patients (shown

hypoglycaemia patients were interviewed using a questionnaire to assess the num- ber, frequency and severity of hypoglycaemic episodes during treat- ment with insulin. a 'mild' episode of hypoglycaemia was defined as one which was self-treated, during which there had been no alter- ation in conscious level, while a 'severe' episode required external assistance for recovery, whether or not loss of consciousness had oc- curred. three variables were obtained from the questionnaire: life- time frequency of severe hypoglycaemic episodes; lifetime total number of severe episodes; and the number of mild and severe epi- sodes in the preceding 8 weeks. two sub-groups of patients were identified who either had ex- perienced no previous episodes of severe hypoglycaemia (n = 24, group a), or who had a history of several previous episodes (five or more) of severe hypoglycaemia (n - 23, group b). the groups were balanced for pre-morbid iq, age, duration of diabetes and social class. to attempt verification of the information obtained by the questionnaire on hypoglycaemia, the general-practice records and hospital out-patient and in-patient case-notes of these patients were scrutinized for documentary evidence of previous episodes of severe hypoglycaemia. in addition, relatives were questioned about the in- cidence and severity of nocturnal hypoglycaemia. we were able to confirm that the diabetic patients who reported having experienced multiple episodes of severe hypoglycaemia had required treatment on several occasions, although the exact number of episodes experi- enced in a lifetime could not be ascertained with accuracy because of incomplete documentation or treatment in other centres. some general practitioners confided that they did not always enter a writ- ten record in the patient's file of emergency treatment of acute hypo- glycaemia. of the 24 diabetic patients who claimed never to have ex- perienced severe hypoglycaemia, evidence to the contrary was obtained for only one patient. this individual was recorded to have experienced three hypoglycaemic episodes of moderate severity, as- sociated with alcohol consumption, and had on one occasion taken an intentional overdose of insulin. each of these episodes had been treated with oral carbohydrate. assessment of cognitive ability the wechsler adult intelligence scale-revised (wais-r; [21]) was used to assess current intellectual level. verbal, performance and full scale iqs were obtained. performance sub-tests used were: pic- ture completion, block design, object assembly and digit symbol. the following verbal sub-tests were used: information, vocabulary, arithmetic comprehension and similarities. the national adult reading test (nart; [22]) was used to assess pre-morbid iq, i.e. the peak cognitive level attained by the patient prior to any cognitive deterioration. this estimate of iq is resistant to organic brain damage and correlates highly with wais-r iq in healthy adults [23]. the rey auditory verbal learning test (avlt; [24]) was used to as- sess both short- and long-term memory. patients were given five trials to learn a list of 15 words which they were asked to recall (a) immediately, (b) after interference, and (c) after a 30 minute delay. the borkowski verbal fluency test (controlled association) [25] is thought to assess frontal lobe function. patients were given 60 s to state as many words as possible, beginning with letters specified by the tester. inspection time (it; [26]) was used to assess perceptual speed. pa- tients were asked to discriminate the spatial position (left or right) of the longer of two briefly-presented vertical lines of markedly differ- ent lengths. the stimuli were backward-masked, the presentation duration was varied, and the amount of time needed to make a re- liable discrimination (85% correct) is termed the patient's 'inspec- tion time'. reaction time (rt). a delay in reaction time is a common charac- teristic of brain damage. a four-choice reaction time test was used, and separate decision and movement times were obtained. decision times and their standard deviations tend to be related to higher cog- nitive functions [27]. the paced auditory serial addition task (pasat; [28]) was used to assess concentration and attention. this has proved to be sensitive in detecting the mild cognitive deficits associated with closed head in- jury. patients listened to a list of numbers which were then added together according to a given rule. after practice, two trials of 61 di- gits were performed with 4 and 2 seconds between successive digits, respectively. cognitive impairment: in the past iq decrement scores were calcu- lated by subtracting the scores of those wais subtests which dete- riorated with ageing from those which did not [29]. this method was largely replaced by the use of demographic indices to estimate pre- morbid iq, from which current iq scores might be subtracted to give a decrement score [23, 29]. more recently, the nart has been shown to be a more accurate estimate of pre-morbid iq than demo- 340 table 4. pearson (and partial) correlations between measures of

subtracting current performance iq (wais-r) from the nart estimated (pre-morbid) performance iq. the estimate of pre-morbid iq (the nart) was originally standardised on the wais prior to revision. the wais and the nart iq measures over-estimate the wais-r iq by seven points [21]. therefore, the nart iq estimates were adjusted by seven points for all subjects in the present study. glycaemic control." blood glucose was measured at the time of psy- chological testing to ensure that no patient had biochemical hypogly- caemia, and total glycated haemoglobin (hba1) was also estimated by electroendosmosis using commercially available agar plates (nor- mal range 5-8%). mean values are shown in table 1. the hba~ re- sults over the preceding year were also reviewed to assess preceding glycaemic control. statistical analysis a correlational design was used. pearson correlations were com- puted to establish whether a relationship existed between the psy- chological variables and the hypoglycaemic indices for the full sample of 100 patients. the potentially confounding effects of age, duration of diabetes or prevailing blood glucose (at the time of cog- nitive assessment), were excluded from correlations between intel- lectual performance and the indices of hypoglycaemia by the use of partial correlation. in order to demonstrate the extent of any cognitive impairment demonstrated by correlation, a second type of analysis was under- taken. as described above, between-group analyses (using inde- pendent t-tests) were carried out on the sub-groups of diabetic pa- tients at the high and low extremes for exposure to severe hypoglycaemia. the study population was divided approximately into quartiles, representing increasing experience of severe hypogly- caemia. the upper and lower quartiles represented those subjects who had experienced five or more severe hypoglycaemic episodes in their lifetime, and those who had never experienced a severe hypo- glycaemic episode, respectively. the fact that five episodes was chosen was arbitrary, and served only to produce two balanced, equal-sized groups with different experiences of hypoglycaemia. two-tailed tests of significance were used thoughout. results the incidence of severe hypoglycaemia in the group of 100 diabetic patients is shown in table 2. intellectual functioning the pearson and partial correlations between intellectual functions and the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia are shown in table 3. the other indices of hypoglycaemia did not correlate significantly with the psychological vari- ables, but the results of statistical analyses employing these indices are shown in all tables. a significant corre- lation was obtained between the frequency of severe hy- poglycaemia and the degree of intellectual impairment (r = -0.24, p < 0.02), and with performance iq (r = 0.26, p < 0.01), but not with verbal iq. therefore, patients with more frequent severe hypoglycaemia had a greater degree of intellectual impairment. this impairment consisted of a reduction in performance iq, with preservation of verbal s. j. langan et al.: cognitive impairment and hypoglycaemia 120 .~ 11o o 100

scores are significant, while all of the verbal subtests show near- to-zero correlations. these correlations were maintained when partial correlations were performed, suggesting that the relationship between the frequency of severe hypogly- caemia and intellectual function is not attributable to any of the confounding effects of age, duration of diabetes or the blood glucose concentration at the time of testing. 341 time (r =-0.34, p < 0.001) and the movement time (r = -0.20, p < 0.05). decision time standard deviation cor- related significantly with both frequency (r =-0.28, p < 0.01) and number (r = 0.29, p < 0.01) of severe hypo- glycaemia episodes. a significant correlation was ob- served between inspection time and frequency of severe hypoglycaemia (r = -0.20, p < 0.05) only after the effects of age, duration of diabetes and blood glucose were par- tialled out. therefore, the diabetic patients who had a history of frequent severe hypoglycaemia had a slower mean speed of, and greater variance in, information pro- cessing. the pasat test scores correlated significantly with the estimated total number of hypogtycaemic episodes in a lifetime (r =-0.21, p < 0.05), and tended to do so with the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia (r =-0.17, p < 0.1). memory and verbal fluency the pearson and partial correlations between estimates of memory and verbal fluency and the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia are shown in table 5. no more significant correlations than would be expected due to chance were observed between these variables, suggesting that mem- ory and verbal fluency had not been impaired by exposure to recurrent severe hypoglycaemia. between-group analyses to demonstrate the extent of the intellectual impairment established by correlational analysis, the two sub-groups of patients (groups a and b) were examined. patients with a history of five or more severe hypoglycaemic epi- sodes had an iq decrement of 7.9 points (over half a standard deviation, p < 0.01, fig. 1), whereas those with no episodes of severe hypoglycaemia fell from pre-morbid iq levels by a mean of only 2.1 points (ns). therefore, pa- tients exposed to multiple episodes of severe hypogly- caemia lost 5.8 iq points more than those with no history of severe hypoglycaemia, and this difference tended to- ward significance (fig.l; t = 1.71, p <0.1). the two sub- groups tended to differ in performance iq (t = 1.80, p < 0.1). furthermore, the group with previous severe hy- poglycaemia exhibited significantly slower decision times (t = 2.44, p < 0.02, fig.2a) and greater decision time standard deviations (t=2.19, p <0.03, fig.2b), and tended to have slower movement times (t = 1.78, p < 0.08) in the choice reaction time test. no other between group comparisons were significant. information processing the pearson and partial correlations between informa- tion processing measures and hypoglycaemia indices are shown in table 4. in the choice reaction time test signifi- cant correlations were observed between the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia and both the median decision discussion the potentially cumulative deleterious effect of repeated episodes of severe hypoglycaemia on cognitive function has been examined previously in diabetic patients. bale, using a word learning test, reported that 17 of a group of 100 adult diabetic patients scored within the "brain-dam- 342 aged" range [17]. their impaired performance appeared to be associated with an increased number and severity of episodes of preceding hypoglycaemia, but other condi- tions such as co-existing cerebrovascular disease were not excluded. bale estimated the iq decrement of 15 of the 17 'damaged' diabetic patients by subtracting their wechsler adult intelligence scale (wais) performance iq from their wais verbal iq. he found only one patient who had a "significant" iq loss of 28 points. a decrement of this magnitude is very large and would not be expected follow- ing a moderate number of episodes of severe hypogly- caemia. we have re-analysed bale's published data and found that the mean iq decrement in the 15 diabetic pa- tients tested on the wais was 5 iq points, which would be significant if it could be replicated in a larger group. a study by franceschi et al. [18] suggested that some factor associated with diabetes results in poorer cognitive per- formance, but it failed to exclude causes other than hypo- glycaemia. contrary to bale [17], lawson et al. [19] concluded that cognitive deficit was not a cardinal feature of a diabetic clinic population. however, an iq decrement is usually recorded when a subject suffers organic brain damage after having attained full cognitive development. this may have been precluded in some of lawson's diabetic subjects because patients with an onset of diabetes as early as 6 years of age were included. wredling et al. [20] reported that insulin-dependent diabetic patients with recurrent and severe hypoglycaemia scored lower on tests of motor ability, memory and general problem solving than a matched group with no severe hypoglycaemia. this is a potentially important result because there appear to be few confounding variables in the study and the cogni- tive deficit appears to be attributable to the preceding hypoglycaemia. they concluded that the cognitive differences of the two groups were not related to pre-mor- bid intellectual status which was not estimated using a direct test, but was inferred from level of education. the results of the present study suggest that the fre- quency of severe hypoglycaemia is significantly related to the observed degree of intellectual impairment, and to measurements of performance iq, inspection time and re- action time. by partialling out potentially confounding variables from the correlations, and by adhering to rigo- rous exclusion criteria to avoid the possible effects of other organic cerebral disease, it appeared that the rela- tionship between the frequency of severe hypoglycaemia and cognitive function could not be attributed to age, duration of diabetes or transient derangement of blood glucose control. the correlations between the psychologi- cal variables and the indices of hypoglycaemia are not high, partly as a result of the limited reliability of the as- sessment of the frequency of hypoglycaemia and possibly because hypoglycaemia may not be the only cause of intel- lectual deficit. however, the magnitude of the correla- tions is less important than the potential replicability of these relationships which often achieved high levels of sig- nificance. because large numbers of patients were in- volved in the significant correlations, the 95% confidence intervals are very small, and do not include zero, sugges- ting that these results will be replicable. the measure of s. j. langan et al.: cognitive impairment and hypoglycaemia cognitive decline employed in this study is an improve- ment upon previous measures of iq decrement, and relies upon the observation that the nart gives an accurate es- timate of pre~morbid iq after an individual has under- gone cognitive decline. without this measure of cognitive decline the question of whether low iq led to more epi- sodes of severe hypoglycaemia rather than the converse would have remained open and unanswered. correlational analysis, involving a large number of patients, was used to establish the relationship between hypoglycaemia and a reduction in cognitive function. furthermore, by comparing patients who had never experienced severe hypoglycaemia with patients who had experienced five or more episodes of severe hypogly- caemia the extent of this impairment was demonstrated. the two groups were balanced for potentially confound- ing variables. this approach demonstrated that those diabetic patients who had experienced multiple severe episodes tended to have a significant reduction in intellec- tual capacity (over half a standard deviation on the iq scale), and had declined by 5.8 iq points more than the group with no severe hypoglycaemia. the group exposed to severe hypoglycaemia also tended to exhibit reductions in performance iq and reaction time. this study has dem- onstrated a cumulative deficit attributable to multiple severe hypoglycaemic insults, but does not indicate the possible degree of intellectual impairment which may occur in individual diabetic patients following an isolated hypoglycaemic coma. one major difficulty of any retrospective study of this nature is the problem of accurate recall by the patients of the number of severe episodes of hypoglycaemia which may have occurred over several years. after reviewing the three estimates obtained from our hypoglycaemia ques- tionnaire, with respect to their accuracy of recall and their relevance to organic brain damage, it was concluded that 'frequency of severe hypoglycaemia' offered the best combination of reliability and validity, and that this ex- plains why it was the measure which most often correlated significantly with cognitive test scores. patients found that it was relatively easy to recall their approximate fre- quency of severe hypoglycaemia, but a retrospective determination of the total number of severe episodes over several years of treatment was very difficult. the number of episodes of hypoglycaemia in the preceding 8 weeks was easy to recall and was probably very accurate, but the episodes were so few in number that this measure was not considered to be relevant to an assessment of the role of hypoglycaemia in causing progressive and cumulative or- ganic brain damage over several years. in an attempt to validate our estimates of hypoglycaemia, the clinical rec- ords of those 47 patients who were included in the group analyses were examined in detail. some general practi- tioners admitted that a written record of emergency treat- ments in the community was not always made in the pa- tient's case records, which thereby diminished the number of recorded events. despite these difficulties with incom- plete documentation, we were able to verify that the two groups who reported either never having experienced severe hypoglycaemia or having been exposed to multiple episodes, had provided highly accurate information, s. j. langan et al.: cognitive impairment and hypoglycaemia which was consistent with their allocation to each group on historical grounds. in all but one case the data obtained from the medical records was in perfect agreement with the information provided by the patients. the findings of the present study are congruent with the studies of diabetic adults by bale [17] and wredling et al. [20], and support observations in diabetic children, which indicate that a relationship exists between a history of recurrent severe hypoglycaemia and intellectual status [31-33]. the present study suggests intellectual deficits in- duced by hypoglycaemia may occur in adults who develop diabetes after cerebral maturity has occurred. this pro- gressive reduction in iq related to hypoglycaemia has im- plications for individuals in occupations which depend heavily on intellectual function and which require the ap- plication of reasoning and judgement to novel material. patients who are performing at the limits of their intellec- tual capacity might decline below a threshold of com- petence as a result of hypoglycaemia-induced cognitive impairment. this would reduce their efficiency and could jeopardize their employment. iq may be compromised further in diabetic patients by the supervening effects of age and the development of premature cerebrovascular disease. while this study does not provide incontrovertible proof that recurrent hypoglycaemia directly damages cerebral function, the results do suggest an association be- tween frequency and severity of neuroglycopenia and a decline in cognitive function. diabetic patients on intensi- fied insulin regimens experience more severe hypogly- caemia than on conventional therapy, and this problem may be compounded by the development of counterregu- latory hormonal deficiencies and hypoglycaemia un- awareness [34]. many patients are at risk of experiencing prolonged and severe hypoglycaemic coma, with the potential result of inducing permanent and cumulative in- tellectual deficit. although this conclusion was supported by wredling et al. they were unable to exclude conclusive- ly the possibility that those subjects with more severe hy- poglycaemia have lower pre-morbid levels of ability [20]. prospective diabetic management with insulin should therefore take into account the possible long-term conse- quences of severe and frequent hypoglycaemia, which should be avoided at all costs. the design of this study overcomes some of the defi- ciencies of previous studies: confounding effects were eliminated, modern iq decrement estimates were used, a large number of subjects was studied, an attempt was made to quantify each subject's experience of hypogly- caemia, and a time-consuming, rigorous check was made on the validity of the retrospective reports of hypogly- caemia in approximately half of the subjects. it will take a prolonged prospective study, which will estimate the num- ber and intensity of hypoglycaemic episodes in patients over several years [1], to provide definitive evidence, but the significance levels of our findings indicate that there is sufficient validity in detailed retrospective reports to con- duct useful research in this area. acknowledgements. this research was supported by the scottish hospital endowments research trust (shert grant 949). we 343 thank dr. r. prescott for statistical advice during the design and ana- lysis stages of the study, and drs. o. boland and i. scougal for assis- tance with medical examinations. references 1. the dcct research group (1987) the diabetes control and complications trial (dcct): results of feasibility study. diabetes care 10:1-19 2. lawrence rd, meyer a, nevin s (1942) the pathological changes in the brain in fatal hypoglycaemia. q j med 35 (ns 11): 181-201 3. patrick aw, campbell iw (1990) fatal hypoglycaemia in insulin- treated diabetes mellitus- clinical features and neuropathologi- cal changes. diabetic med 7:349-354 4. frier bm, hilsted j (1985) does hypogtycaemia aggravate the complications of diabetes?

cognitive ability and brain structure in type 1 diabetes relation to microangiopathy and preceding severe hypoglycemia stewart c. ferguson,1annette blane,2petros perros,1rory j. mccrimmon,1jonathan j.k. best,2 joanna wardlaw,3ian j. deary,4and brian m. frier1 type 1 diabetes is associated with chronic hyperglyce- mia and exposure to intermittent severe hypoglycemia.the long-term cerebral effects of these consequences ofdiabetes are ill deﬁned. in this study, the history ofpreceding severe hypoglycemia and the presence ofbackground retinopathy were examined in relation tocognitive ability (neuropsychological test battery) andbrain structure (magnetic resonance imaging) in across-sectional evaluation of 74 young people with type1 diabetes. participants differed by their severe hypo-glycemia exposure and degree of diabetic retinopathyand none had previous neuropsychological pathology.severe hypoglycemia did not inﬂuence cognitive abilityor brain structure. background diabetic retinopathywas associated with small focal white-matter hyperin-tensities in the basal ganglia (33.3 vs. 4.7%, after cor-rection for age, p/h115490.005) and signiﬁcant cognitive disadvantage, affecting ﬂuid intelligence ( p/h115490.008, eta 2/h115490.14), information processing ( p/h115490.001, eta2/h11549 0.22), and attention and concentration ability ( p/h115490.03, eta2/h115490.09). in conclusion, recurrent exposure to severe hypoglycemia alone in young people with type 1 diabetes had no detrimental impact on brain structureor function over the duration of diabetes examined.chronic hyperglycemia (inferred by the presence ofbackground diabetic retinopathy) may affect brainstructure and function. diabetes 52:149–156, 2003 intensiﬁed insulin therapy, which can achieve strict glycemic control and reduce the risk of diabeticmicroangiopathy, is associated with a threefoldhigher incidence of severe hypoglycemia (1). pro- tracted severe hypoglycemia is uncommon but may causepermanent neurological and cognitive deﬁcits. anecdotal reports have described speciﬁc neurological and cognitivedeﬁcits following protracted severe hypoglycemia thatwere associated with localized neuroimaging abnormali-ties (2–7), predominantly affecting the frontal lobes and deep gray matter, which appear more susceptible tohypoglycemia-induced damage (8). it is undeterminedwhether recurrent severe hypoglycemia, in the absence ofprotracted coma, can have long-term deleterious effects onintellectual function. the human brain depends on contin-uous glucose availability and rapidly malfunctions duringhypoglycemia but quickly recovers; a single episode ofhypoglycemic coma temporarily impairs intellectual func-tion, but no permanent effects on cognitive abilityare evident after 36 h (9). prospective studies, with anevaluation period of up to a decade, have found thatrecurrent severe hypoglycemia had no detrimental effecton cognitive function in young people with type 1 diabetes(10–12). however, cross-sectional studies of older adultsin whom type 1 diabetes had commenced after adoles-cence, and who had a longer duration of disease, havedemonstrated a modest but signiﬁcant cognitive decre-ment associated with the frequency of preceding severehypoglycemia (13–16). a study of a small subgroup ofthese subjects, using magnetic resonance imaging (mri)of the brain, suggested that cortical atrophy was moreprevalent in those with a history of frequent exposure tosevere hypoglycemia (17). cerebral macrovascular disease is increased in type 1 diabetes, and the incidence rises with age (18). multipleneuropathological abnormalities have been describedpostmortem in brains of individuals with type 1 diabeteswho had end-stage microangiopathy (19), but the abnor-malities could not be attributed exclusively to diabeticmicroangiopathy, because macrovascular disease, hyper-tension, and uremia coexisted. thus, whether the devel-opment of cerebral microangiopathy is caused by diabetesper se remains speculative. the concept of a multifactorial“diabetic encephalopathy” has been proposed (20), withdiabetic microangiopathy, metabolic derangements, andhypertension as contributors (21). the potential relation-ship between diabetic microangiopathy, cognitive perfor-mance, and brain structure has been addressed in a fewsmall studies that were confounded by comorbidity(20,22,23). an increased frequency of high-intensity le- from the1department of diabetes, the royal inﬁrmary of edinburgh, edin - burgh, u.k.; the2department of medical

cerebral white matter (leukoaraiosis) repre- senting foci of ischemia and gliosis (24) were described ina small cohort with a long duration of type 1 diabetes whohad microangiopathy, hypertension, and uremia (20),whereas no cerebral mri abnormalities were observed inanother study of subjects who had laser-treated prolifera-tive retinopathy (22). a further neuroimaging study re-ported an increased frequency of cerebral atrophy inpeople with type 1 diabetes but was too small to offer cluesas to causality (23). the present study examined a group of young people with type 1 diabetes of relatively long duration, who haddeveloped the disorder during childhood or adolescence,and who may be at greater risk of developing cognitiveimpairment than those with adult-onset type 1 diabetes(25). this study was designed to ascertain the possiblelong-term consequences of preceding recurrent severehypoglycemia, the presence of microvascular disease (asretinopathy), and their interaction on cerebral structureand cognitive performance and to determine whether anycorrelation existed between structural and functionalbrain states. this study was not designed to examine theeffects of diabetes per se on cognitive function.design. the study was cross-sectional in design, and the study protocol was completed as follows: detailed mri ofthe brain, neuropsychological test battery, retinal exami-nation, and assessment of preceding severe hypoglycemia.each component was evaluated and scored blind to allother information.subjects. recruitment criteria were chosen with the aim of obtaining a cohort with a long duration of diabetes ( /h1102210 years), suf ﬁcient to ensure exposure to the metabolic consequences of interest (severe hypoglycemia and dia-betic retinopathy), but without other signi ﬁcant confound- ing comorbidity. subjects who had developed type 1diabetes in childhood or adolescence (age at diagnosis/h1102118 years) and who had attained full intellectual develop- ment (aged /h1102220 years) at the time of the study were recruited. an age limit of 45 years was applied to minimizepotential confounding effects of aging on cognitive abilityand brain structure. participants either had no evidence ofdiabetic microvascular complications or had backgroundretinopathy alone. people with more advanced degrees ofretinopathy (airlie house grading [26] /h113502), including maculopathy, preproliferative, proliferative retinopathy,or previous laser-treated retinopathy, were excluded tominimize the potential confounding in ﬂuence of visual impairment. the presence of any form of clinical neurop-athy and microalbuminuria were also considered exclu-sion criteria. other exclusions included hypertension(deﬁned as blood pressure /h11022140/90 mmhg), central ner- vous system pathology, previous alcohol or drug misuse,or any other multisystem disease known to affect thecentral nervous system. a total of 74 individuals with type 1 diabetes were recruited, and 71 participants completed the study proto-col, with 3 participants failing to perform the cognitiveassessment. the data presented are representative ofthose who completed the study protocol. the clinicalcharacteristics of the study cohort are summarized intable 1. altogether 25 subjects (35%) had backgrounddiabetic retinopathy, identi ﬁed by digital retinal imaging and direct ophthalmoscopy, de ﬁned by the presence of two or more microaneurysms in one eye (airlie housegradings 1a –1c [26]). severe hypoglycemia was de ﬁned as an episode that required external assistance for recovery,identical to the diabetes control and complications trial(dcct) de ﬁnition (1). severe hypoglycemia exposure was assessed retrospectively using a validated hypoglycemiaquestionnaire (27). to improve the accuracy of estimates,participants were requested to discuss their severe hypo-glycemia history with relatives or friends before complet-ing questionnaires. details were recorded of the lifetimetotal number of episodes, the frequency of occurrence ofepisodes, and the total number of episodes of convulsions,coma, and other episodes requiring medical assistance totreat the hypoglycemia. using the above de ﬁnition, 20 subjects (28%) had never experienced severe hypoglyce-mia and 51 (72%) had experienced one or more episode(table 1). subdividing the cohort by presence of back-ground retinopathy showed a similar level of exposure tosevere hypoglycemia between the two subgroups, with aslight excess of preceding severe hypoglycemia in thesubgroup with no retinopathy. the participants with es-tablished retinopathy were slightly older and tended tohave had diabetes of longer duration, although bothtable 1 characteristics of participants with type 1 diabetes no

localization, two sequences were used to image thewhole brain (28). the ﬁrst scan was a double spin-echo sequence giving simultaneous proton-density and t2-weighted images (relaxation time [tr]/h110053,565 ms, echo time [te] /h1100520 ms and 90 ms, 31 contiguous 5-mm slices acquired in the talairach plane, and ﬁeld of view [fov] 250 mm) that were used to calculate whole-brain and cerebrospinal ﬂuid volumes using a supervised cluster analysis package (analyze; mayo foundation, rochester,mn). the second scan, for the regional volumetric analysis, was a threedimensional magnetization prepared for rapid-acquisition gradient echo se-quence consisting of a 180-inversion pulse followed by a fast low-angle shotcollection (flip angle 12, tr /h1100510 ms, te /h110054 ms, ti /h11005200 ms, relaxation time delay time 500 ms, and fov 250 mm) giving 128 contiguous 1.88-mm thickslices in the coronal plane orthogonal to the talairach plane. inhomogeneitycorrections were performed on sun microsystem workstations using ana-lyze to outline neuroanatomical structures. the temporal lobe and amygdala-hippocampal complex were identi ﬁed, the areas outlined, and volumescalculated by summing voxels in the regions of interest. mri scans were reviewed by an experienced neuroradiologist (j.w.), scored independently,and blinded to clinical factors for the presence of high-intensity white-matterlesions (leukoaraiosis) (29 –36). several scoring systems were used to capture the intensity, distribution, and appearance of white-matter lesions, as nosingle scale was judged to be an adequate summary (37). mri scans were alsoscored for the presence of small punctate white-matter lesions (spwmls) thatwere not accounted for by any of the above rating scales (fig. 1). a scale of0–3 (none [0], mild [ /h1102110], moderate [10 –20], and severe [ /h1102220]) was used to quantify spwmls, indicating enlarged perivascular spaces in three brainregions (hippocampus, basal ganglia, and centrum semiovale) using the mostaffected hemisphere. cerebral atrophy was de ﬁned as “central ”(i.e., with enlargement of the ventricles) or “gyral ”(i.e., with enlargement of the sulci) and rated on a subjective scale of 0 –3 (absent [0], mild [1], moderate [2], and severe [3]).assessment of neuropsychological function. the neuropsychological test battery was chosen to be sensitive to small-to-moderate differences in abilityand to provide an assessment of some major cognitive domains. trainedassessors, blinded to the diabetes characteristics of participants, administeredneuropsychological tests in a standardized manner. blood glucose wasmeasured before the cognitive assessment to exclude prevailing hypoglyce-mia. the neuropsychological session was rescheduled if antecedent hypogly- cemia occurred within the preceding 24 h. the neuropsychological tests used were as follows: fig. 1. spwmls (enlarged perivascular spaces). this example shows more

10.0 (spss, chicago, il). the relationship between demographic variables andneuropsychological performance or mri outcomes (atrophy and white-matterlesions, coded numerically) was examined initially using correlation (spear-man ’s/h9267). neuropsychological performance was analyzed by domain to reduce the possibility of type 1 error before subanalysis of individual tests wasattempted. demographic factors correlating with neuropsychological and mrioutcomes were entered into a multivariate linear model (mancova), to takeaccount of potential confounding in ﬂuences. this technique was used to determine which, if any, of the clinical complications of diabetes in ﬂuenced brain structure and neuropsychological performance and to estimate themagnitude of their in ﬂuence (eta 2). the neuropsychological model used included retinopathy status, severe hypoglycemia exposure (categorized as tertiles of lifetime episodes), and gender as between-subject variables, andpremorbid iq (nart) and duration of diabetes as covariates. the brainvolume model used retinopathy status, severe hypoglycemia (as tertiles oflifetime episodes), and gender as between-subject variables and age andintracranial volume as covariates. parameters were selected on the basis ofprior hypotheses and correlates between demographic variables and neuro-psychological performance. the interaction between retinopathy and severehypoglycemia was also explored; diabetes complications were coded into fourcategories (none, retinopathy alone, hypoglycemia alone, or both complica-tions), and signi ﬁcance was determined using anova with conservative post hoc comparisons (scheffe).results cognitive ability severe hypoglycemia and neuropsychological per-formance. no measure of preceding severe hypoglycemia correlated with neuropsychological performance. the cor-relation coef ﬁcients (spearman ’s/h9267) between estimates of preceding severe hypoglycemia and neuropsychologicalperformance are shown in table 2.background diabetic retinopathy and cognitive per-formance. the relative neuropsychological performance of those with and without background retinopathy isshown in table 3, along with the estimated effect size(eta 2) of background retinopathy and premorbid iq (nart). any cognitive difference between these two groups is not a consequence of more education or priorability, because these variables are very similar in bothgroups (table 1). those subjects who had background retinopathy performed less well across most cognitivedomains examined. retinopathy was associated with com-paratively poorer current intellectual performance(wais-r performance iq, p/h110050.008) of moderate effect size (eta 2/h110050.14), particularly notable for the block design and digit symbol substitution subtests, which assess spatial ability and mental ﬂexibility/psychomotor speed, respectively. information processing ability (sum ofzscores for crt and it) was poorer in those with retinopathy ( p/h110050.001), and the effect size was moderate to large (eta 2/h110050.22). both components of the information processing tests were affected: crt (decision time com- ponent

also poorer in those who had retinopathy(p/h110050.03, eta 2/h110050.09). the presence of retinopathy was not associated with a performance disadvantage on the borkowski verbal fluency test, a test

abnormalities on neuroimaging were generally at the mildend of the spectrum. high-intensity periventricular whitematter lesions, particularly small punctate lesions (fig. 1),periventricular caps, or pencil-thin rims (figs. 2 aandb) were common and present in one-third of scans. deepwhite matter lesions were observed infrequently.severe hypoglycemia and brain structure. no signif- icant correlation was identi ﬁed between any measure of previous exposure to severe hypoglycemia and mri neu-roimaging abnormalities. in particular, no relationship wasobserved between the presence of high-intensity lesions inthe cerebral white matter ( /h9267/h110050.018, p/h110050.90) or cerebral atrophy ( /h9267/h11005/h11002 0.026, p/h110050.84) and any measure of severe hypoglycemia.background retinopathy and cerebral abnormali-ties on mri. no association was observed among back- ground retinopathy, cerebral atrophy, or brain volumetricmeasurements (table 4). the presence of backgroundretinopathy was associated with more frequent spwmlsin the region of the basal ganglia. one-third (33.3%) ofthose with background retinopathy had mild basal gangliaperiventricular spwmls ( /h1102110 lesions) compared with 4.7% of those with no retinopathy. the relationship re-mained statistically signi ﬁcant ( p/h110050.01) after considering the in ﬂuence of age and gender (mancova), but back- ground retinopathy only accounted for a small proportionof the variance in spwml scores (eta 2/h110050.09), and the presence of spwmls was not associated with neuropsy-chological performance. spwmls in the hippocampus orcentrum semiovale, or a summation of spwmls in allareas, were no more frequent in those who had back-ground retinopathy. white matter lesions other than smallpunctate lesions (i.e., leukoaraiosis), as rated by publishedscales (29,30,32 –36), were no more common in those who had background retinopathy than in those who did not.duality of cerebral insults: chronic hyperglycemia,severe hypoglycemia and brain structure. cerebral atrophy or white matter lesions, in the form of spwmls orleukoaraiosis, were no more prevalent in those who hadbackground retinopathy and who had also experiencedsevere hypoglycemia than in those with only backgroundretinopathy. discussion in the present study, no signi ﬁcant relationship was iden- tiﬁed between previous exposure to severe hypoglycemia and cognitive ability. this is consistent with the observa-tions of the dcct (10,12) and the stockholm diabetesintervention study (sdis) (11), both of which evaluatedcognitive function in young adults who had been exposedto recurrent severe hypoglycemia. however, retrospectivecross-sectional studies in adults with type 1 diabetes(13–16) have revealed modest decrements in cognitive function, directly related to the frequency of previousrecurrent severe hypoglycemia, in people who developedtype 1 diabetes in adulthood and who were older than theparticipants of the present study. this could imply that theaging brain may be more susceptible to the effects ofsevere hypoglycemia. the apparently reassuring ﬁndings with respect to exposure

the assessment of cognition was not comprehensive; learning, memory ability, abstractreasoning, and a detailed examination of executive func-tions were not examined. based on our previous ﬁndings, the focus of the present study was on general cognitiveability and information processing (14). in the present study, structural abnormalities of the brain were not observed in association with a historyof preceding severe hypoglycemia. no relationship wasidenti ﬁed between the frequency of previous severe hypo- glycemia and cerebral atrophy, in contrast to the observa-tions of an earlier study (17), which examined a smallnumber of older participants recruited from a largercohort (14,27) who had developed type 1 diabetes inadulthood. in addition, in analyzing these earlier results(17), differences between the incidence of microvasculardisease in the study groups were not considered (82% inthose previously exposed to severe hypoglycemia vs. 55%in those who were not exposed to severe hypoglycemia).these differences may underlie the apparent disparity withthe results of the present study, which suggest that recur-rent severe hypoglycemia may not be detrimental to thebrain, at least in young adults /h1102145 years of age who do not have established microangiopathy. this reassurance can-not at present be applied to older people with type 1diabetes or to those with a longer duration of the disorder. a signi ﬁcant association was found between the pres- ence of background diabetic retinopathy and cognitiveability, which remained robust when between-subject fac-tors and covariates (age, gender, premorbid iq, and dura-tion of diabetes) were considered. the subgroup that hadbackground diabetic retinopathy performed less well oncognitive tests of ﬂuid intelligence, information processing speed, and the ability to maintain attention and concen tra- tion. the magnitude of the difference observed in cognitiveperformance was moderate (0.4 –0.7 sd), i.e., approxi- mately equivalent to 10 iq points, and was similar to thatobserved by other studies that examined the relationshipbetween microangiopathy and cognition (20,45). however,the differences observed in cognitive performance in thepresent study may be evident at a lesser degree of cumu-lative lifetime glycemic exposure (46). the reasons for thisare unclear but may re ﬂect differences in the sensitivity of neuropsychological test batteries to hyperglycemia-asso- fig. 2. a: a t2-weighted image from a diabetic patient. note the minimal rim of increased signal around the lateral ventricles

january 2025 ciated cognitive change and the different cognitive do- mains assessed. the mechanism by which backgroundretinopathy may confer these differences in cognitive abilityis unknown. differences in visual function were consid-ered as being potentially responsible for the differences inability associated with retinopathy, yet the visual compo-nent of the information processing pathway (as measuredby p100 latency) is unaffected by background retinopathy(47). it is more likely that the presence of diabetic retinop-athy (which infers that microangiopathy is present in othertissues) is a surrogate marker of preceding suboptimalcontrol of diabetes with chronic hyperglycemia. high-intensity white-matter lesions (leukoaraiosis) rep- resent areas of increased water content, gliosis, and de-myelination within white matter (24) and are thought tosignify foci of microvascular ischemia (48). the spwmlsof the type that were associated with background retinop-athy in this study are thought to correspond to enlargedperivascular spaces, in keeping with diabetic microangi-opathy in other tissues. the intracranial circulation, withthe exception of the ophthalmic artery, was previouslythought to be spared by diabetic microangiopathy. to ourknowledge, the association observed in the present studybetween background retinopathy and spwmls in thebasal ganglia has not been previously reported and sug-gests that microangiopathy affects cerebral microvesselsbeyond the con ﬁnes of the ophthalmic artery. basal gan- glia abnormalities have been previously observed in youngpeople with type 1 diabetes, with infarction in associationwith microvascular complications (49) and hemorrhage inassociation with ketoacidosis (50,51). the vascular supplyto the basal ganglia is via an end-arterial system, similar tothe retinal circulation, which may therefore explain theirapparent vulnerability. this observed association between background retinop- athy and spwmls is consistent with other observationsassociating retinal vascular abnormalities with white-mat-ter lesions on cranial mri scans. hypertensive retinopathyis associated with cerebral high-intensity white-matterlesions (52), implying that retinal microangiopathy is amarker of diffuse cerebral microangiopathy in hyperten- sion. despite the association observed in the present studybetween background retinopathy and spwmls, the pres-ence of these white-matter lesions was not associated withcognitive ability. this may imply that diabetic retinopathyand spwmls do not in fact represent an identical his-topathological abnormality. alternatively, the pathogene-sis of diabetic retinopathy and spwmls may be similar,with nonexudative retinopathy representing an early man-ifestation and spwmls (enlarged perivascular spaces)indicating more advanced damage. a further explanationis offered by the difference in sensitivity for the detectionof microangiopathy provided by cerebral magnetic reso-nance imaging when compared with ophthalmoscopy anddigital retinal imaging. the pathognomonic lesion of back-ground diabetic retinopathy, the microaneurysm, is a fewmicrons in size, whereas the voxel size utilized in mrineuroimaging protocols is several orders of magnitudegreater. irrespective of the association between background retinopathy and structural brain abnormalities, the cogni-tive differences observed in the subgroup with establishedbackground diabetic retinopathy is likely to have a vascu- lar etiology. functional mri studies suggest that cerebro-vascular responsiveness is important during normalcognition, as discrete changes in regional cerebral bloodﬂow occur during cognitive tasks (53). long-duration type 1 diabetes complicated by retinopathy has been shown tobe associated with impaired cerebrovascular responsive-ness (54), and it is possible that such a mechanism may beassociated with the differences in cognitive ability ob-served in the present study. in addition, the results of thepresent study support the concept of a “microvascular- mediated ”effect on cognitive function in people with diabetes of long duration, as a contributory factor in thepathogenesis of a “diabetic encephalopathy. ” an interaction between multiple complications of dia- betes and cognitive performance has been previouslyreported. ryan et al. (45) identi ﬁed an association between poorer cognitive performance and peripheral neuropathyin adults who had developed type 1 diabetes in childhoodor adolescence, although no direct detrimental effect ofsevere hypoglycemia alone was detected. a signi ﬁcantly greater degree of cognitive dysfunction was observedwhen peripheral neuropathy coexisted with a history ofprevious exposure to recurrent severe hypoglycemia. thepresent study did not identify any greater difference incognitive ability in those who had background retinopathyand a history of exposure to recurrent severe hypoglyce-mia when compared with those who had backgroundretinopathy alone. however, the numbers constituting thesubgroups ( n/h110058 vs. n/h1100517) for this analysis were small, and no ﬁrm conclusions regarding the presence or absence of an interaction among microangiopathy, severe hypogly-cemia, and cognitive ability can be drawn from the presentstudy. in conclusion, the present study indicates that neither structural abnormalities of the brain of known clinicalsigni ﬁcance nor cognitive impairment were common in young adults with type 1 diabetes. spwmls of uncertainclinical signi ﬁcance were observed more frequently in the brains of those with the microvascular complication ofretinopathy and may be related to chronic hyperglycemia.in people with type 1 diabetes, the exposure to chronichyperglycemia and the development of generalized mi-croangiopathy may have a more detrimental effect on thebrain than recurrent exposure to severe hypoglycemia.prospective studies are required to validate the aboveﬁndings, which, if substantiated, will have important im- plications for the clinical management of diabetes inroutine practice. acknowledgments s.c.f. and r.j.m. were

absence of adverse effects of severe hypoglycemia on cognitive function in school-aged children with diabetesover 18 months timwysocki ,phd1 michael a. h arris,phd2 nellymauras ,md3 larry fox,md3alexandra taylor ,ma1 s. c raigjackson ,bs2 neilh. w hite,md, cde2,4 objective — some children with type 1 diabetes may be at risk of cognitive impairments, but mechanisms of this effect have not been conﬁrmed. the objective of this study was todetermine whether severe hypoglycemia (sh) in children with type 1 diabetes is associated withcognitive decline over 18 months. research design and methods — a sample of 142 6- to 15-year-old children with type 1 diabetes (mean age 11.6 /h110062.7 years) enrolled in a trial of intensive therapy (it) or usual care (uc) were tested with the das-naglieri cognitive assessment system at baseline andafter 9 and 18 months. episodes of sh were recorded by parents and reported promptly forveriﬁcation by study nurses. hba 1cwas measured quarterly. results — over 18 months, 58 of 142 patients (41%) experienced 111 sh episodes, with a rr of sh of 1.12 for it over uc. neither occurrence nor frequency of sh was associated withdecline in full-scale intelligence quotient (iq), standard scores for planning, attention, simulta-neous processing, or successive processing, or scaled scores on any of eight subtests. the sameﬁndings emerged when only patients who had experienced hypoglycemic seizures or coma wereincluded in the sh group for analyses. these effects persisted when the child’s age, sex, type 1diabetes duration, and age at diagnosis were controlled statistically. hba 1cduring the trial was not associated with cognitive changes. conclusions — sh did not induce adverse changes in the measures of cognitive function administered to 6- to 15-year-old children with type 1 diabetes in this study. although shshould be avoided in all children with diabetes, these episodes did not have adverse effects oncognition in this age-group over 18 months. diabetes care 26:1100–1105, 2003 some children with type 1 diabetes may be at risk of cognitive deﬁcits,especially those diagnosed at earlier ages, those with lower socioeconomic sta-tus, and boys (1–6). these ﬁndings arewell established but not well explained(1,4,5) because putative mechanisms such as duration of type 1 diabetes, aver-age long-term glycemia, frequency of di-abetic ketoacidosis, total duration ofhypoglycemia, and frequency of severehypoglycemia (sh) are confounded. dif-ferentiating the effects of these variables requires prospective studies that isolatetheir cognitive effects (1,5). acute hypo-glycemia impairs cognition transiently(7–9). it has been more difﬁcult to provethat the adverse cognitive effects of hypo-glycemia persist or accumulate. somestudies implicate sh as a factor in cogni-tive decline (10–16), whereas others donot (17–20). different studies often re-port different sh-related cognitive impair-ments (10–16). the literature is beset bymethodological issues such as small sam-ples, retrospective evaluation of sh, failureto control for other mechanisms, and col-lection of numerous cognitive measures rel-ative to sample size. these concerns mustbe addressed in subsequent studies to re-solve these contradictory ﬁndings. this article analyzes associations be- tween sh and cognition prospectively.the data reported here were collectedduring a randomized trial of usual care(uc) versus intensive therapy (it) for 6-to 15-year-old children with type 1 dia-betes. that study followed 142 childrenin their randomly assigned treatments for18 months, with various measures col-lected at baseline, 9 months, and 18months, including the das-naglieri cog-nitive assessment system (cas) (21–23),a new test of cognitive processing. parentscompleted prospective diaries of sh, de-ﬁned as in the diabetes control and com-plications trial (dcct) (24). our hypotheses were that 1) sh will be associated with a decline in cas pri-mary domain and subtest scores over 18months and 2) decline in cas scores as- sociated with sh will be independent of the child’s age, sex, duration of diabetes, age atdiagnosis, or mean hba 1cover this period. research design and methods participants participants were 142 youth who com-pleted an 18-month prospective study of●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●●● from

ticipants were 6 –15 years old and were diagnosed with type 1 diabetes for at least2 years or for 1 year with a negligible stim-ulated c-peptide level. randomizationwas strati ﬁed according to the patient ’s age and hba 1cand was performed by the trial coordinator at the other center. the primary purpose of the trial was to iden-tify variables that predicted bene ﬁt from the two regimens. because comparison ofthese treatments is not the focus of thisreport, the regimens are described brie ﬂy. it comprised at least three daily insulininjections, including premeal injectionsor use of an insulin pump; at least fourblood glucose tests daily; and utilizationof expertise in medicine, nursing, nutri-tion, and psychology needed to assistfamilies to maintain, to the degree attain-able, an hba 1c/h113496.5%. it patients re - ceived approximately four times morecontacts with nurses, dietitians, and psy-chologists than those in the uc group.uc patients received the routine profes-sional assistance available at the two clin-ics, administered two or three dailyinsulin injections, performed three to fourblood glucose tests daily, and strove for anhba 1c/h113498.0%. for purposes of ethical treatment, glycemic targets were relaxed for children who experienced /h113502 epi- sodes of sh within 6 months. parents andchildren gave informed consent or assentbefore enrollment. an external panel ofthree pediatric endocrinologists reviewedthe data and adverse events semiannually. measures comprehensive evaluations of psycho-logical factors that could affect it out-comes were completed before random-ization and 9 and 18 months later. mea-sures analyzed for this report were thedas-naglieri cas (21 –23), parental re- ports of sh episodes, and hba 1c. cognitive processing. the das-naglieri cas was used to measure the componentsof intelligence (21 –23). the cas yields a full-scale intelligence quotient (iq) andstandard scores (100 /h1100615; means /h11006sd) for four domains of cognitive function:planning, attention, simultaneous pro-cessing, and successive processing, eachwith/h9251reliabilities /h113500.84. each cognitive domain was measured using two subtestswith a normative mean scaled score of10/h110063 and with /h9251reliabilities /h113500.75. construction of the cas was based a pri-ori on modern empirical research on the structure of intelligence and on a well-validated theoretical model. a total of 9years of psychometric validation of thesubtests preceded its standardizationwith a large, carefully strati ﬁed national sample of 3,072 youth (21 –23). previous studies have shown that the cas is sensi-tive to parental retrospective reports oftheir children ’s histories of sh (25), to closed-head injuries in children (26), andto subtle processing de ﬁcits found in learning disabilities (23). the cas do-mains of cognitive function and their as-sociated subtests are described below. planning encompasses evaluating a novel problem, generating solutions tothat problem, projecting the outcomes ofthose strategies, selecting a strategy forimplementation, and monitoring its effec-tiveness. these processes are assessedwith the matching numbers subtest, inwhich the child must select a multidigitnumber identical to one of several similarnumbers, and the planned codes subtest,in which the child must detect repeatingsequences of letters. attention involves recognizing and responding to speci ﬁc stimuli while in- hibiting reaction to distractors. withinthis domain, the number detectionsubtest requires the selection of “target ” numerals hidden within an array of dis-tractors, and the expressive attentionsubtest requires the child to state whethera pictured animal is big or small in reality,regardless of the relative size of the ani-mal’s picture on the page. simultaneous processing includes mental operations that require consider-ation of all elements of a complex stimu- lus concurrently. within this domain, thenonverbal matrices subtest requires thechild to select the geometric design thatcompletes a progression of designs, andthe verbal-spatial relations subtest re-quires the child to select one of four pic-tures that illustrate the examiner ’s de- scription of the objects ’relationships in space. successive processing consists ofmental operations in which stimuli areconsidered sequentially, and these opera-tions must be completed in a certain or-der. within this domain, the word seriessubtest requires the child to restate, in or-der, sequences of words spoken by theexaminer, and the sentence repetitionsubtest requires the repetition of non-sense sentences spoken by the examiner.we selected the cas because it mea- sures the same cognitive functions overthe 5- to 18-year age range; it is based onluria ’s model of cognitive processing and on modern research on the structure ofintelligence; it consists of tasks that areinﬂuenced minimally by the child ’s aca- demic, social, or linguistic experiences;and it was expected to be sensitive to sub-tle changes in cognitive function (21 –23). sh. parents recorded their children ’s ap- parent sh episodes. as in the dcct, sh was de ﬁned as the occurrence of coma or seizure, or an episode requiring adminis-tration of intravenous glucagon or dex-trose or assistance from another person(24). diary forms recorded the child ’s symptoms, possible causes, blood glucosetest results, and treatment(s) adminis-tered. parents documented this informa-tion immediately after any apparent shepisode. parents telephoned the studynurse during the next business day to re-view each such episode to verify that itmet the dcct criteria (24). the measure-ment of sh in young children is problem-atic because they typically requireassistance from others in correcting anyhypoglycemia. project nursing staff dif-ferentiated mild and moderate hypogly-cemia from more severe episodes basedon the nature and severity of the child ’s symptoms as reported by the parents. ap-propriate education and/or changes inmedical regimen were instituted aftereach sh episode to minimize recurrences.average glycemia. hba 1cwas mea -

of sh did not result ina decline in scores on any primary cogni-tive domain. because sh episodes withcoma or seizures could have more potenteffects on cognitive function, we repeatedthe analyses comparing the 39 patientswho had experienced such an event withthe 84 no-sh patients. again, none ofthese analyses showed statistically signif-icant between-group or group-by-timeinteraction effects, indicating decline incognitive function among patients who had experienced this most severe type ofsh episode. the above analyses of sh vs. no-sh effects on the cas primary domains wererepeated with

experience adverse effects of sh on theﬁve primary cas standard scores than were older children. repetition of theseanalyses with age at diagnosis of diabetes,duration of diabetes, and child ’s sex as

experi- enced signi ﬁcant declines in any cas measure over 18 months; scores in-creased slightly over time in all sub-groups. controlling statistically for thechild ’s age, age at diagnosis, and duration of type 1 diabetes did not alter the resultsof these analyses. mean hba 1cover the 18 months was also evaluated as a correlate of cognitive decline. patients were divided into tertilesbased on mean hba 1cover the study (/h110217.7, 7.7 –8.5, and /h110228.5%). there were no signi ﬁcant main or interactive effects among these hba1cgroups on any cas score. conclusions —neither the pres- ence/absence nor the frequency of sh wasassociated with a decline in children ’s performance on a modern intelligencetest. scores on these measures increased,rather than decreased, independently ofthe occurrence of sh. the magnitude ofthe increases in scores did not differ as afunction of either the presence/absence orfrequency of sh. these ﬁndings held when age, duration of diabetes, sex, andage at diagnosis were controlled statisti-cally, indicating that boys, younger chil-dren, and those with earlier diagnosiswere at no increased risk of cognitive de-cline due to sh during the study. a com-parison of cas scores among no-shpatients with those who had experiencedeither a hypoglycemic coma or seizurealso failed to reveal adverse effects on cog-nitive function. the results also indicatedthat mean hba 1cduring the study was not associated with changes in any mea- sure of cognitive function. at the ﬁnest level of analysis that is possible with thecas, there were no statistically signi ﬁcant changes in scaled scores on any of theeight subtests related to sh. these ﬁndings demonstrate that sh did not result in a measurable decline inthe domains of cognitive function exam-ined in this study. these observations areimportant because the present study eval-uated children ’s cognitive functioning and occurrence of sh prospectively,rather than retrospectively, in a samplethat was comparatively large relative tosimilar investigations (6 –18). the ﬁnd- ings contrast with those of other studiesthat have reported deleterious cognitiveeffects of sh (10 –16,25) but are consis- tent with those studies reporting no suchassociation (17 –20). among the former reports, the most ambitious and soundstudy, contributed by northam et al. (16),found that wechsler full-scale iq and ver-bal iq scores were affected mildly by sh,with regression analyses indicating thatsh accounted for 3 and 6%, respectively,of the variance in these two types ofscores. using different tests, the presentstudy found no such effect on any of theﬁve cas primary cognitive domains, in- cluding the full-scale iq. the cas wasintentionally designed to incorporate cog-nitive tasks that are relatively unaffectedby linguistic stimulation and cultural op-portunities. thus, it includes no measurethat can be compared directly to the ver-bal iq measured by northam et al. (16).other methodological differences are thatthe northam study had a longer fol-low-up period (6 years vs. 18 months)and that the comparison group in thenortham study consisted of healthy chil-dren from the community, whereas thecomparisons in the present study were ofchildren with type 1 diabetes who did anddid not experience sh during an 18-month period. northam et al. (16) con-cluded that sh was a plausible cause ofcognitive decline over time in childrenwith type 1 diabetes, but they could notrule out that chronic hyperglycemia mayhave yielded these changes. there are limitations to this study. sensitivity to adverse cognitive effects ofsh may be greatest among children whoare younger than those enrolled in thisstudy. the present results cannot be gen-eralized to children /h110216 years of age. fur- thermore, adverse cognitive effects of shthat were not evident during this 18-month study could emerge with a longerfollow-up interval. also, children in thisstudy were retested over a rather shortinterval. the 9-month interval betweenevaluations was relatively brief, such thatscores from the second and third admin-istrations may have been in ﬂated by prac- tice effects. conceivably, these practiceeffects may have masked real deteriora-tion in cognitive function by diminishingthe sensitivity of the cas to subtle differ-ences in cognitive function. however, themagnitude of the practice effects did notdiffer with respect to either the presenceor absence or the frequency of sh. thetests used in this study differed from thoseof previous investigations, and the ﬁnd- ings could have differed if other tests hadbeen selected. the present study did notcompare performance directly on the cas with tests previously shown to be sensi-tive to sh. other studies have shown ad-verse effects of sh on subtler measures ofcognitive function than were adminis-tered here (5,11 –13). it is reasonable to suspect that the cas may have been in-sensitive to such effects. however, in pre-vious studies, cas scores were sensitiveto retrospective parental reports of theirchildren ’s frequency of sh (25) and to cognitive sequelae of closed-head injury(26). administration of a battery includ-ing measures previously found to be sen-sitive to sh, along with the cas, couldclarify whether the present ﬁndings are speci ﬁc to this battery or are more general. avoidance of sh must always remain a cornerstone of the management of type1 diabetes. however, the present ﬁndings suggest that sh did not impair cognitivefunction in children /h113506 years old who were followed for 18 months on eitherstandard or intensive therapies for type 1diabetes. acknowledgments —this research was sup- ported by national institutes of health

clinically relevant cognitive impairment in middle-aged adultswith childhood-onset type 1 diabetes diabetes care 2015;38:1768 –1776 |doi: 10.2337/dc15-0041 objective the aim of this study was to investigate the presence and correlates of clinically relevant cognitive impairment in middle-aged adults with childhood-onset type 1diabetes (t1d). research design and methods during 2010 –2013, 97 adults diagnosed with t1d and aged <18 years (age and duration 49 67a n d4 1 66 years, respectively; 51% female) and 138 similarly aged adults without t1d (age 49 67 years; 55% female) completed extensive neuro- psychological testing. biomedical data on participants with t1d were collectedperiodically since 1986 –1988. cognitive impairment status was based on the number of test scores ‡1.5 sd worse than demographically appropriate published norms: none, mild (only one test), or clinically relevant (two or more tests). results the prevalence of clinically relevant cognitive impairment was ﬁve times higher among participants with than without t1d (28% vs. 5%; p<0.0001), independent of education, age, or blood pressure. effect sizes were large (cohen d0.6–0.9; p<0.0001) for psychomotor speed and visuoconstruction tasks and were modest (d0.3–0.6;p<0.05) for measures of executive function. among participants with t1d, prevalent cognitive impairment was related to 14-year average a 1c>7.5% (58 mmol/mol) (odds ratio [or] 3.0; p= 0.009), proliferative retinopathy (or 2.8; p= 0.01), and distal symmetric polyneuropathy (or 2.6; p= 0.03) measured 5 years earlier; higher bmi (or 1.1; p= 0.03); and ankle-brachial index ‡1.3 (or 4.2; p= 0.01) measured 20 years earlier, independent of education. conclusions clinically relevant cognitive impairment is highly prevalent among these middle- aged adults with childhood-onset t1d. in this aging cohort, chronic hyperglycemiaand prevalent microvascular disease were associated with cognitive impairment,relationships shown previously in younger populations with t1d. two additionalpotentially modi ﬁable risk factors for t1d-related cognitive impairment, vascular health and bmi, deserve further study. 1department of epidemiology, graduate school of public health, university of pittsburgh, pittsburgh,pa 2department of psychiatry, school of medicine, university of pittsburgh, pittsburgh, pa 3department of neurology, university of pittsburgh, pittsburgh, pa corresponding author: caterina rosano, rosanoc@ edc.pitt.edu. received 8 january 2015 and accepted 10 june 2015. this article contains supplementary data online at http://care.diabetesjournals.org/lookup/suppl/doi:10.2337/dc15-0041/-/dc1. © 2015 by the american diabetes association. readers may use this article as long as the workis properly cited, the use is educational and notfor pro ﬁt, and the work is not altered.karen a. nunley,1caterina rosano,1 christopher m. ryan,2j. richard jennings,2 howard j. aizenstein,2janice c. zgibor,1 tina costacou,1robert m. boudreau,1 rachel miller,1trevor j. orchard,1and judith a. saxton31768 diabetes care volume 38, september 2015pathophysiology/complicationsdownloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/38/9/1768/625006/dc150041.pdf by guest on 13 january 2025 modest cognitive dysfunction is consis- tently reported in children and youngadults with type 1 diabetes (t1d) (1). mental ef ﬁciency, psychomotor speed, executive functioning, and intelligencequotient appear to be most affected(2); studies report effect sizes between0.2 and 0.5 (small to modest) in childrenand adolescents (3) and between 0.4 and0.8 (modest to large) in adults (2). whethereffect sizes continue to increase as thosewith t1d age, however, remains unknown. a key issue not yet addressed is whether aging individuals with t1d have an in- creased risk of manifesting “clinically rel- evant cognitive impairment, ”deﬁned by comparing individual cognitive testscores to demographically appropriatenormative means, as opposed to themore commonly investigated “cognitive dysfunction, ”or between-group differen- ces in cognitive test scores. unlike theextensive literature examining cognitiveimpairment in type 2 diabetes, we knowof only one prior study examining cogni- tive impairment in t1d (4). this early study reported a higher rate of clinicallyrelevant cognitive impairment amongchildren (10 –18 years of age) diagnosed before compared with after age 6 years(24% vs. 6%, respectively) or a non-t1dcohort (6%). cognitive impairment is important to study in an aging t1d population be-cause these individuals are concurrentlyexposed to the consequences of long- term t1d and the negative effects of advancing age on cognition. further-more, several risk factors for age-relatedcognitive impairment, such as hyperten-sion (5) and impaired renal function (6),are highly prevalent in t1d, yet the con-tribution of these factors to worseningcognitive function in an aging t1d co-hort remains unknown. characterizingcognitive impairment in aging partici-pants with t1d is warranted based onﬁndings from cognitive studies of aging populations without t1d: cognitive im- pairment is related to poor self-care (7),high costs (8), and disability (9). cogni-tive impairment in t1d likely has similaradverse effects. this study tests the hypothesis that childhood-onset t1d is associated withan increased risk of developing clinicallyrelevant cognitive impairment detectableby middle age. we compared cognitivetest results between adults with and without t1d and used demographicallyappropriate published norms (10 –12) to determine whether participants met cri-teria for impairment for each test; agingand dementia studies have selected ascore$1.5 sd worse than the norm on that test, corresponding to performanceat or below the seventh percentile (13).we also assessed relationships betweent1d-speci ﬁc variables and cognitive impair- ment; based on the diabetes control andcomplications trial (dcct)/epidemiology of diabetes interventions and compli- cations (edic) study ’s 18-year cognitive follow-up results, we hypothesized thatcognitive impairment would be associ-ated with smoking history, high bloodpressure, prevalent microvascular com-plications, and poor metabolic control(14). research design and methods participants middle-aged adults with t1d ( n= 97; mean age and duration of diabetes 49 and 41 years, respectively) were re-cruited from the pittsburgh epidemiol-ogy of diabetes complications (edc)study, an ongoing prospective study ofindividuals diagnosed before age 18years and listed in the children ’sh o s p i - tal of pittsburgh ’sd i a b e t e sr e g i s t r y .t h e ﬁrst edc clinical assessment occurred in 1986 –1988 ( n= 658; mean age and du- ration of diabetes 28 and 19 years, re- spectively). biennial physical exams and questionnaires occurred through 1996 – 1998, with an additional exam in 2004 – 2006 (for details see ref. 15). all locallydwelling edc participants as of 1 january2010 ( n= 263) were invited to partici- pate in an ancillary neuroimaging/neuro-cognitive study. of those, 81 refused,26 never responded, and 2 were lost tofollow-up. of the 154 interested, 37were ineligible for mri (e.g., metallic im-plants, claustrophobic) and 5 had sched- uling con ﬂicts, leaving 112 eligible and scheduled for neuroimaging/neurocog-nitive testing. of these, three failed toshow for their scheduled visit. on theirscheduled testing date, another threerefused the mri and nine refused thecognitive test battery, yielding an ana-lytic sample of n= 97 (supplementary fig. 1). adults without t1d who were partici- pating in an observational study of the effects of prehypertension (blood pres- sure higher than “normal ”but not high enough to qualify as hypertensive) oncerebral structure and function served as a comparison group. inclusion criteriawere age 35 –60 years, local to pitts- burgh, and blood pressure within thevalues of 120 –139/80 –89 mmhg. full exclusion criteria are provided in supple-mentary appendix 1. of the 414 who re-sponded to the mailing/advertisementand were screened to participate, 110were ineligible for mri, 60 changed theirmind, and 14 withdrew, leaving 230 en- rolled (mean age 46 years). to mirror the edc ’s primarily caucasian racial distribu- tion, only caucasian participants withcomplete neuroimaging/neurocognitivedata as of august 2013 ( n= 138) were included. all study procedures received local in- stitutional review board approval, andall participants provided informed con-sent before any res earch procedures were initiated. measures for all participants, blood pressure, bmi,and serum glucose were measured us-ing standardized techniques at the timeof cognitive testing. participants with se-rum glucose #70 mg/dl were given a snack then retested after 15 min; no cog-nitive testing was performed if serumglucose was #70 mg/dl. weekly calo- ric expenditure (kcal) was estimatedusing the self-report paffenbarger questionnaire. as part of edc, metabolic control and blood pressure were assessed bienniallyfrom baseline through 1996 –1998, again in 2004 –2006, and at the time of neurocognitive testing (2010 –2013); this allowed calculations of long-termaverage blood pressure and glycemiccontrol (hba 1cand “a1cmonths, ”ac a l - culated measure assessing the degreeand duration of hyperglycemia [for de-tails see ref. 16]). in 1990 –1992, arterial health was assessed via the ankle-brachial index (abi); two readings were averaged,then dichotomized as ,1.3 or.1.3/ noncompressible. an abi .1.3 is corre- lated with medial arterial calci ﬁcation (17), which is associated with arterial stiff-ening (18). prevalence of t1d complica-tions (nephropathy, coronary arterydisease, distal symmetric polyneurop-athy, cardiac autonomic neuropathy, ret-inopathy) was assessed biennially from baseline through 1996 –1998, then again in 2004 –2006, using highly standardized methods (for details see ref. 15).care.diabetesjournals.org nunley and associates 1769downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/38/9/1768/625006/dc150041.pdf by guest on 13 january 2025 cognitive assessment cognitive measures included estimated verbal intelligence (north american adult reading test [naart]);

mild = only one test score impaired; clinically relevant =two or more test scores impaired. thisclassi ﬁcation scheme is validated and used in epidemiologic studies to assesscognitive impairment in community-dwelling adults aged $75 years (13). between-group differences in the levelof cognitive impairment were assessedusing the fisher exact test, controllingfor education (fig. 1). to examine factors related to between- group differences in cognitive impairment,characteristics that differed betweengroups (false discovery rate [fdr] = 0.20;table 1) were entered in ordinal logistic regression models with level of cognitiveimpairment as the outcome and t1d sta-t u sa st h em a i nc o v a r i a t e( t a b l e3 ) . sensitivity analysis, excluding partici- pants with a history of high blood pressure($140/90 mmhg or using antihyperten- sive medication), was conducted to en- sure that the imbalance in high bloodpressure was not confounding results.in analyses restricted to participants with t1d, characteristics were com-pared ﬁrst across level of cognitive im- pairment using the fisher exact test for categorical variables and anova for continuous variables (table 1). charac-teristics that differed at fdr = 0.20 thenwere entered into separate ordinal lo-gistic regression models with level ofcognitive impairment as the outcome,controlling for years of education (sup-plementary table 1). all models met theproportional odds assumption ( p.0.1). to adjust for multiple comparisons, we applied an fdr of 0.20 per the benjamini-hochberg correction method. education-adjusted pvalues were sorted from lowest to highest, then thebenjamini-hochberg correction was ap-plied to identify statistically signi ﬁcant variables, accepting that 20% may befalse positives. this corresponded to apvalue of 0.03 (supp lementary table 2) when comparing factors between par-ticipants by t1d status (table 1, “no t1d ”and “t1d ”columns), of 0.06 (sup- plementary table 3) when comparing factors among participants with t1dby cognitive status (table 1, “degree ofcognitive impairment ”columns), and of 0.10 (supplementary table 4) when com-paring cognitive test scores by t1d status(table 2). we chose this method over family-wise correction methods because of the paucity of prior studies; we wouldrather falsely identify factors as deservingfurther investigation than reject factorsthat actually warrant additional study. in the ordinal logistic regression mod- els (table 3, supplementary table 1), themore stringent bonferroni method wasused to control for multiple comparisons. results both cohorts were comparable in age,male-to-female distribution, systolicblood pressure, bmi, and apolipopro-tein e4 (apoe4) status (table 1). com-pared with participants without t1d,participants with t1d were signi ﬁcantly more likely to have a history of highblood pressure (38% vs. 8%; p, 0.0001), higher serum glucose (174.5vs. 91.3 mg/dl; p,0.0001), lower di- astolic blood pressure (66 vs. 80 mmhg; p,0.0001), and lower estimated weekly physical activity (1092 vs. 1628 kcal;p= 0.03) (table 1).table 2 —raw cognitive test scores for participants with t1d (edc) and participants without t1d domain testraw score effect size ( d)† t1d (mean 6sd) no t1d (mean 6sd)difference (no t1d –t1d) mean % pvalue* iq naart number correct 37.1 69.4 43.3 610.3 6.2 215.0 0.0005 ‡ 0.62 estimated verbal iq (scaled)§ 108 681 1 3 695 . 0 24.5 0.0012 ‡ 0.59 psychomotor speed dsst 54.5 613.5 63.4 611.8 8.9 215.0,0.0001 ‡ 0.72 gp| 88.8633.2 69.0 617.6 19.8 25.1 ,0.0001 ‡ 1.02 executive function stroop color-word 41.4 69.5 44.2 68.8 3.2 27.5 0.06 ‡ 0.58 tmt part b | 65.4638.5 53.4 622.3 12.0 16.5 0.02 ‡ 0.47 ratio b to a | 2.561.4 2.0 60.7 0.5 21.2 0.002 ‡ 0.54 vf fas 44.4 613.8 48.2 611.9 3.7 27.4 0.10 ‡ 0.30 ln sequence 11.0 62.9 11.9 62.8 1.0 28.2 0.05 ‡ 0.34 memory rey auditory verbal learning sum of trials 1 –55 4 . 1 68.9 56.0 69.0 2.0 23.7 0.44 0.22 interference 6.4 62.6 6.9 61.9 0.5 27.5 0.34 0.24 delayed recall 11.0 63.0 11.4 63.0 0.4 24.0 0.65 0.15 rocf-delayed 18.6 66.7 19.9 66.6 1.3 26.6 0.41 0.20 4wstm 5-s list 15.2 63.1 16.3 63.2 1.1 27.0 0.10 ‡ 0.35 15-s list 12.3 64.1 13.4 63.8 1.2 29.2 0.17 0.31 30-s list 10.5 64.5 11.1 64.7 0.6 25.8 0.76 0.14 visuospatial rocf-copy 30.7 65.4 33.9 63.4 3.2 29.9,0.0001 ‡ 0.88 semantic ﬂuency vf animals 21.7 65.3 23.3 65.5 1.5 26.5 0.14 0.28 *pvalue for mean difference in test score, adjusted for years of education. †effect size (cohen d) calculated as t(n1 + n2)/ !df(n13n2) to account for unequal sample sizes and unequal variances (source: http://www.uccs.edu/lbecker/effect-size.html, accessed 11 december 2014). ‡statistically signiﬁcant using a fdr of 0.20. §estimated verbal iq calculated as 128.7 20.89 (naart incorrect). ǁtasks in which a higher score indicates worse performance;

gp: 45% vs. 10%), executivefunction (tmtb: 12% vs. 5%; vf: 10% vs.2%; vf animals: 8% vs. 1%; stroop color-word: 8% vs. ,1%), and visuoconstruc- tion ability (rocf-copy: 20% vs. 4%)(fig. 1 b). participants with t1d were also more likely to have two or more tests impaired, hence meeting our de ﬁ- nition of clinically relevant cognitiveimpairment (28% vs. 5%; p,0.0001; fig. 1 a). in ordinal logistic regression models with level of cognitive impairment asthe outcome, having t1d was relatedtoﬁvefold increased odds of having cognitive impairment (table 3). this re-lationship remained stable when con-trolling for education. importantly, noother factors signi ﬁcantly modi ﬁed this between-group difference. in sensitivity analyses excluding p articipants with a history of high blood pressure, havingt1d remained signi ﬁcantly associated with higher odds of cognitive impair-ment (odds ratio [or] 4.35; p= 0.001), and no other factors signi ﬁcantly modi- ﬁed this relationship. when comparing participants with t1d by level of cognitive impairment,we found no statistically signi ﬁcant dif- ferences by sex, age, t1d duration, age at t1d diagnosis, serum glucose at time of cognitive testing, estimated glomeru-larﬁltration rate, apoe4 status, physical activity, blood pressure measures, orprevalence of coronary artery disease,cardiac autonomic neuropathy, or overtneuropathy measured 5 years earlier(table 1). compared with cognitivelynormal participants with t1d, thosewith mild or clinically relevant cognitiveimpairment had signi ﬁcantly fewer years of education, higher bmi, and worse long-term glycemic control;were more likely to have a 20-year prioraverage abi .1.3; and were more likely to have prevalent distal symmetric poly-neuropathy or proliferative retinopathymeasured 5 years earlier (table 1). rela-tionships remained similar when control-ling for serum glucose or a 1cat the time of neurocognitive testing. among participants with t1d, ordinal logistic regression models with level of cognitive impairment as the outcomeshowed that having a 14-year (1996 –2013) average hba 1c$7.5% (58 mmol/mol) tri- pled the odds of cognitive impairment(supplementary table 1, model 1). re-sults were similar for prevalent prolifera-tive retinopathy or distal symmetricpolyneuropathy (supplementary table 1,models 2 and 3). each unit increase in bmiwas associated with a 10% increased odds of cognitive impairment (supplementary table 1, model 4). an average abi.1.3/noncompressible quadrupled the odds of cognitive impairment (sup-plementary table 1, model 5). these figure 1 —a: percentage of participants scoring $1.5 sd worse than published normative data in no, one, two, three, or four or more tests. white bars indicate participants without t1d;

we chose 14-year average a 1crather than a 1cat a sin- gle assessment concurrent with cogni- tive testing to assess the chronicity ofhyperglycemia. all analyses were re-peated, controlling separately for serumglucose then for a 1cat the time of cog- nitive testing, to ensure glucose concen-trations were not confounding studyresults. similar to previous studies of younger adults with t1d (14,26), we found norelationship between the number of se- vere hypoglycemic episodes and cogni- tive impairment. rather, we found thatchronic hyperglycemia, via its associ-ated vascular and metabolic changes,may have triggered structural changesin the brain that disrupt normal cogni-tive function. like others (14), we foundno statistically signi ﬁcant relationships between cognitive impairment andapoe4 status. whereas earlier studiesfound relationships between cognitive dysfunction and age at t1d diagnosis (4,27 –29), diabetes duration (29,30), and high blood pressure (21,29,30),these factors were not signi ﬁcantly cor- related with cognitive impairment in oursample. this could be a result of our out-come of cognitive impairment com-pared with previous studies ’outcome of cognitive dysfunction. in addition,participants in those earlier studieswere younger, on average, than our par- ticipants and may therefore have not yet developed cognitive impairment. we also identi ﬁed two less-studied factors related to cognitive impairmentin our sample. first, we found thath i g h e rb m iw a sr e l a t e dw i t hh i g h e rodds of cognitive impairment (or 1.10;table 3), similar to results reported bybrismar et al. (29) showing relationshipsbetween higher bmi and de ﬁcits in psy- chomotor speed as well as general in- telligence in adults with t1d. while the exact mechanism relating bmi and cog-nitive function remains unclear, oneplausible route is via an in ﬂammatory pathway (31). in animal models of t1d,higher levels of circulating glucocorti- coids and higher susceptibility to stresswere associated with high bmi, in-creased brain in ﬂammation, and re- duced neurogenesis (32). higher bmicould also indicate insulin resistance,which also is related to worse cognitiveoutcomes in older participants who arehealthy or have type 2 diabetes (33).future studies should further investi-gate the in ﬂuence of bmi on cognitive function in young participants with t1d to determine whether this could be a riskfactor suitable for early intervention. second, we found that participants with an average abi .1.3/noncom- pressible had quadrupled odds of clini-cally relevant cognitive impairment.high abi is a marker of subclinical vas-cular conditions including atherosclero-sis, vessel stiffness, and calci ﬁcation, all of which are known risk factors for cog- nitive impairment in older adults with- out t1d (34,35). peripheral vascularstiffness, as a result of endothelial dys-function, may serve as an indicator ofearly changes to brain vasculature andstructure (36). as an example, hepatichypoperfusion resulting from endothe-lial dysfunction leads to “increased ad- hesion of circulating in ﬂammatory cells to the endothelium, activation of the co-agulation cascade and constriction of the microvasculature ”(37). cerebral hy- poperfusion likely exerts similar effectson the brain ’s vasculature; diffuse sub- clinical ischemia and resultant damageto oligodendrocytes and focal necrosisin gray and white matter offer a mech-anistic explanation for the relationshipwith cognitive impairment. while theapplicability of this ﬁnding is limited be- cause of the small sample size, this novelpotential risk factor deserves further in- vestigation in participants with t1d. performance on several neurocogni- tive tests used in this study (e.g., dsst,gp, rocf-copy) depend on visual acuityand motor capabilities, skills that arecompromised in participants with t1dwith proliferative retinopathy and distalsymmetric polyneuropathy. while thesecomplications may contribute to poorperformance on these tasks, psychomo-tor speed and executive function appear to be affected even in pediatric populations with t1d, well before such microvascularcomplications occur (3,4). furthermore,performance on several tasks requiringthe same degree of visual acuity and ﬁne1774 edc clinically relevant cognitive impairment diabetes care volume 38, september 2015downloaded from http://diabetesjournals.org/care/article-pdf/38/9/1768/625006/dc150041.pdf by guest on 13 january 2025 motor skills (e.g., the rocf delayed task) did not differ by cognitive status amongparticipants with t1d, suggesting thatprevalent retinopathy and/or polyneu-ropathy alone do not explain the cogni-tive impairment observed in theseindividuals. rather, it suggests thatlong-term t1d causes microvasculardamage in the brain similar to thatknown to affect the eyes and nerves,thereby explaining why participants with proliferative retinopathy and distal symmetric polyneuropathy were morelikely to meet the study de ﬁnition of clin- ically relevant cognitive impairment. the number of participants with t1d completing each neurocognitive taskvaried (see supplementary fig. 2), andthis is a limitation of this study. how-ever, the completers did not signi ﬁ- cantly differ from the noncompletersby retinopathy, polyneuropathy, 14-year average a 1c.7.5%, abi .1.3, bmi, age at cognitive testing, or t1d duration.overall, incompleteness was due to timeconstraints, that is, insuf ﬁcient time to complete all tests within the 90 min allot-ted: 12 participants arrived at the cogni-tive testing center $10 min late, and another 6 were hypoglycemic, requiringat least 15 –30 min for serum glucose con- centrations to normalize before initiatingcognitive testing. lack of time affected completion of the ﬁnal tasks (fas, vf an- imals, stroop, gp); we do not believe thiswas dependent on cognitive status. our study results may not be entirely generalizable to all adults with t1d.first, we included only participantswith childhood-onset diabetes; the cog-nitive effects of t1d on participants di-agnosed during adulthood may differfrom our participants who were ex-posed to chronic hyperglycemia in child- hood, during crucial stages of brain and cognitive functioning development (38).in addition, 99% of our participants arecaucasian, whereas 93% of people diag-nosed with t1d in allegheny county,pennsylvania, from 1965 –1979 were caucasian (39). a survivor bias may bepresent in that these participants havesurvived with t1d for a substantial pe-riod of time. a selection bias is alsopossible; those participating in this cog- nitive study are, in general, healthier than the parent edc cohort, especiallysince the eligibility criteria for participationin the cognitive study included being ableto undergo brain imag ing. many causes ofmortality and morbidity that prevented participation in this study are related tocognitive impairment, potentially under-estimating its true prevalence in t1d. be-cause of the study design, we cannotdetermine direction of the relationshipsbetween cognitive impairment and factorsassessed concurrently, such as a 1con the day of cognitive testing; it could be thatthose with worse cognitive impairmentare less able to manage their diabetes, leading to higher a 1cconcentrations. the study design also prohibits determinationof the life stage at which clinically relevantcognitive impairment ﬁrst developed in our participants. strengths of this study include the use of a well-de ﬁned cohort with over 20 years of data, thus allowing computa-tion of long-term trajectories of risk fac-tor pro ﬁles, and the use of an extensive neuropsychological test battery to as- sess multiple cognitive domains. the cognitive impairment algorithm hasbeen used in previous studies (13), iseasily replicable, and could be adaptedby others to improve comparabilityacross studies. in summation, results of this study show that a large percentage of middle-aged adults with childhood-onset t1dare currently living with clinically rele-vant cognitive impairment. the effects of cognitive impairment on these individ- ualsddiabetes self-management, health service utilization, disability, and quality-of-life issues ddeserve further investiga- tion. future studies with larger samplesizes and a wider range of ages at diagno-sis are needed to improve our under-standing of the development andprogression of t1d-related cognitive im-pairment. such studies should use re-peated neurocognitive testing, beginning shortly after the time of diagnosis. fur- thermore, incorporating repeated neuro-imaging with extensive measures ofmetabolic control and vascular healthwould help to clarify the mechanisms con-tributing to the development of cognitiveimpairment in these individuals. funding .c.r. is the principal investigator of the neurocognitive study of participants with t1d,national institute of diabetes and digestive andkidney

tuomilehto et al. 1999). one of the main goals of diabetes management is to achieve near-normoglycaemia to prevent or to minimize thelong-term complications of diabetes (retinopathy, nephropa-thy, and neuropathy). however, attempts towards near-normoglycaemia can lead to an increasing incidence of hypo-glycemic episodes, which are the most common acute com-plications of insulin therapy. for descriptive and clinical purposes, hypoglycaemia in children can be divided into four categories: (1) asymptomatic(biochemical), (2) mild symptomatic, (3) moderate sympto-matic, and (4) severe hypoglycaemia. in mild symptomatichypoglycaemia, the patients are able to detect and treat thehypoglycaemia by themselves. in moderate hypoglycaemia,the aid of another person is needed. hypoglycaemia is severewhen the patient is unconscious, and/or has convulsions. virtually no hypoglycaemia occurring in children under 6years can be classiﬁed as mild as young children are rarelyable to treat themselves. annually, 5–10% of children withtype-1 diabetes mellitus experience severe hypoglycaemialeading to unconsciousness. they may experience mild symp-tomatic or asymptomatic hypoglycaemic episodes weekly(åman et al. 1989, barkai et al. 1998). it has been noticed that recurrent severe hypoglycaemia can cause long-term cognitive impairment in children withtype-1 diabetes (rovet et al. 1987, bjørgaas et al. 1997, rovetand ehrlich 1999), but valid reports in which such correlationshave not been found also exist (ryan et al. 1985, northam etal. 1992). deﬁcits in verbal abilities (rovet and alvarez 1997),spatial abilities (rovet 2000), attention (bjørgaas et al. 1997,rovet and alvarez 1997), and short-term memory (rovet andehrlich 1999) have been reported in connection with epi-sodes of severe hypoglycaemia. the vast majority of the evi-dence with regard to the long-term effects of hypoglycaemiaon neurocognitive performance is based on adults with long-standing diabetes and the results are controversial (rovet2000). studies on the effects of severe hypoglycaemia in children with diabetes have been made using small sample sizes(rovet et al. 1987, bjørgaas et al. 1997, kaufman et al. 1999).recently, northam and coworkers (1999, 2001) published aprospective study with a large and representative cohort.the variety of tests used to assess different neurocognitivedomains make it difﬁcult to compare results between stud-ies. wide age-ranges within studies have also led to problemsin test selection. many of the neuropsychological tests usedhave either been originally developed for adults (e.g.wisconsin card sorting test; berg 1948) or are experimentaltests, thereby rendering evaluation of the clinical relevanceof the results difﬁcult. in this controlled study we assessed the effects of diabetes and severe hypoglycaemia on neurocognitive functioning inchildren with a comprehensive neuropsychological test battery,including standardized normative values for every age group. 262 developmental medicine & child neurology 2003, 45: 262–268 method participants the study population consisted of 21 children with type-1 dia- betes mellitus and 10 healthy children (table i). the ages of thechildren ranged from 5 years 6 months to 11 years 11 monthsand the duration of diabetes ranged from 1 year 9 months to 9years 7 months. the children with diabetes were outpatients atkymenlaakso central hospital in finland. of the children withdiabetes, 11 had experienced at least one episode of severehypoglycaemia (d+h group), deﬁned as unconsciousnessand/or convulsions associated with blood glucose concentra-tion <3mmol/l or with prompt response to the administrationof glucagon or intravenous glucose. the other 10 children withdiabetes had never experienced severe hypoglycaemia (d–hgroup). the unaffected children served as controls (c group).they consisted of volunteers from the children of hospital staffand children from a local sports club. all children at kymenlaakso central hospital outpatient clinic who had experienced severe hypoglycaemia and metthe criteria for prepubescence (tanner stage 1; tanner 1962)and had normal milestones in psychomotor development(evaluated at well-child clinic and by a paediatrician at the hos-pital) were included in the study. the d+h group wasmatched with the d–h and c groups for sex, age, and parents’educational level. parents’ educational level was categorizedas 1, compulsory 9-year education only; 2, vocational educa-tion or similar; 3, college education or similar; and 4, universi-ty education. the clinical data on severe hypoglycaemia wereconﬁrmed both by interviewing children and their familiesand by reviewing hospital records. of the children with hypo-glycaemia, four had experienced 1 episode, four had 2episodes, two had 3 episodes, and one child had 4 episodes ofsevere hypoglycaemia. the episodes had occurred 9 monthsto 7 years (median 4 years) before the study. the two diabeticgroups did not differ in recent metabolic control, deﬁned ashba1c-value, or in prevalence and severity of initial ketoacido-sis, deﬁned as serum ph<7.3 (see table i). none had beenunconscious during ketoacidosis, and none of the childrenhad experienced later ketoacidosis. the two diabetes groupsdiffered in age at diagnosis and duration of illness. age at diag- nosis was younger and duration of diabetes was longer in thed+h group than in the d–h group (see table i). all the chil-dren had normal psychomotor development and had no his-tory of intrauterine or perinatal problems, other neurologicaldisorders, nor trauma. no one had experienced any psycho-logical crises. all children were in ordinary elementary schoolsexcept for four who were in preschool. neuropsychological assessment the finnish version of the wechsler intelligence scale forchildren–revised (wisc-r; wechsler 1984) was used toassess general intelligence in the children aged 6 years andolder. a 5-year-old child in the d–h group received thefinnish version of the wechsler preschool and primary scale of intelligence–revised (wppsi-r; wechsler 1995). all the verbalsubtests (information, similarities, arithmetic, vocabulary, andcomprehension) were administered and they formed theverbal iq score. performance iq was formed from the picturecompletion, block design, object assembly, and coding sub-tests (picture completion, block design, and object assemblyin wppsi-r). the iq scores (full-scale, verbal, and per-formance iq) have a mean of 100 (sd 15) and for the individualsubtests the mean is 10 (sd 3). the digit span forward assessedverbal short-term memory and was included in the neuropsy-chological domain of memory and learning. the nepsy, a developmental neuropsychological assess- ment (korkman et al. 1997) is a neuropsychological test forchildren 3 to 12 years of age. the finnish version consists of30 neuropsychological subtests designed to assess neuropsy-chological development in ﬁve functional domains: attention/executive functions, language, sensorimotor functions, visuo-spatial processing, and memory and learning. the subtests ofthe finnish version correspond to the english version of thenepsy (korkman et al. 1 998). the subtests have been stan- dardized on a single sample of children (korkman 2000). eachage group has its own standardized normative values wherethe mean standard score is 10 (sd 3). of the 30 nepsy sub-tests, 16 were administered (table ii). the selected subtests neurocognitive functioning in children with diabetes riitta hannonen et al. 263table i: characteristics of diabetes and hypoglycaemia (d+h), diabetes without hypoglycaemia (d–h), and control groups characteristics groups signiﬁcant group d+h d–h control differences (n=11) (n=10) (n=10) sex, n 5 m, 6 f 4 m, 6 f 5 m, 5 f age, y;

(this test is not in the english version of nepsy.) memory and learning picture recognition assesses visual and visuospatial memory. the child is asked to select the photo he has seen in the previous subtest from among four photos of similar objects. (this test is not in the english version of nepsy). memory for names assesses pair-associative memory for visual and verbal information. the child learns the names of the children seen in eight pictures. the pictures are presented three times, and 30min after the last presentation the child is asked to name the children in the pictures again. list learning assesses verbal learning. a 15-item word list is presented over ﬁve trials. an interference list is administered and recalled once, and the child is thenasked to repeat the ﬁrst list. delayed recall time is after 30min. (this subtest was administered only to children who were 7 years and older.) 14698749, 2003, 4, downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1469-8749.2003.tb00341.x by test, wiley

p<0.01] and d–h mean 4.6 [sd 0.52, p<0.01]) when compared with the control group (mean 5.80 [sd 0.92]).in the neuropsychological subtests assessing language func-tions a signiﬁcant difference was found in phonologicalprocesses ( f=3.92 (2, 28), p<0.05). the d+h group had lower standard scores than control children ( p<0.05). in the neuropsychological subtests assessing attention/executivefunctions, visuospatial and sensorimotor functions, all threegroups scored near or over the standard means of the subtests,indicating high-level abilities. group differences were found inthe tower subtest assessing planning and executive processes(f=4.04 (2, 28), p<0.05). a signiﬁcant difference was found between the d–h and c groups ( p<0.05). no statistical differ- ence was found in the wechsler subtests. verbal iq in the d+hgroup was 87.9, in the d–h group 96.3, and in the controlgroup 95.4, but the differences did not reach statistical signiﬁ-cance. because the two diabetes groups differed in age at diagnosis and duration of illness, comparison within the diabetesgroups were made using these variables and parents’ educa-tion as covariates. a signiﬁcant group effect ( f=4.43 (3, 14), p<0.05) was found in attention and executive functions. pairwise comparisons revealed signiﬁcant differences in thetower subtest ( p<0.05), where the d–h group had lower scores than the d+h group, and in auditive attention(p<0.05), where the d+h group performed more poorly than the d–h group. age at diagnosis ( p<0.05) and duration of dia- betes ( p<0.01) were signiﬁcant covariates in the auditive atten- tion subtest. there was no signiﬁcant group effect in any of theother neuropsychological domains nor in intelligence. discussion the aim of the study was to assess the effects of diabetes andsevere hypoglycaemia on neurocognitive functioning in chil-dren. we used a comprehensive, well standardized, and vali-dated, wide age-range neuropsychological test in order toassess a variety of cognitive domains. by means of the nepsy,it is possible to study both basic and complex aspects of neu- rocognitive functioning with subtests appropriate acrosswide age groups, thereby obtaining information on the clini-cal relevance of neurocognitive deﬁcits when compared withage expectations (korkman et al. 1998). a comprehensiveneuropsychological assessment can explain a behaviouraloutcome (e.g. learning difﬁculty) by showing the deﬁcits inbasic function (e.g. phonological processing). in this study, the children with diabetes who had experi- enced severe hypoglycaemia had signiﬁcantly more neu-ropsychological deﬁcits and learning difﬁculty, and theyneeded more special education than the healthy children orthe children with diabetes but without a history of severehypoglycaemia. the clinical signiﬁcance of cognitive impair-ments in children with diabetes has not been fully recognizedin previous studies. signiﬁcant differences were found in ver-bal short-term memory and phonological processing skillsbetween the children who had experienced severe hypogly-caemia and the healthy children. other studies have alsoreported a relation between poorer short-term memory andsevere hypoglycaemia (kaufman et al. 1999, northam et al.1999, rovet and ehrlich 1999). phonological processing skillshave not been assessed comprehensively in previous studies.deﬁcits in auditory–verbal functions, as found in our study,have an inﬂuence on the development of verbal skills. theymay partly explain the lower verbal intelligence in childrenwith a history of severe hypoglycaemia found in the prospec-tive studies by rovet and ehrlich (1999) and northam andcolleagues (2001). the frontal and temporal regions, particularly in the left hemisphere, are involved in language, memory, and atten-tional processes. auer and siesjo (1988) and chalmers andcolleagues (1991) found that abnormal blood glucose levelsin particular affect the frontal and temporal regions of thebrain, especially the hippocampus (auer 1986). in cerebralblood ﬂow studies hypoglycaemia has been shown to havean asymmetrical effect with a greater reduction of left- versusright-hemisphere profusion (jarjour et al. 1995). the brains of infants appear to have an increased vulnera- bility to hypoglycaemia (harwoth and coodin 1960). preterminfants born small for gestational age (lucas et al. 1988),infants of mothers with diabetes (schwartz and teramo2000), and infants with persistent hyperinsulinemic hypogly-caemia (cresto et al. 1998) are most at risk. an adverse neu-rodevelopmental outcome can be seen even after moderateneonatal hypoglycaemia (lucas et al. 1988), and prolongedor repeated episodes of profound neonatal hypoglycaemiamay lead to severe learning disability* and epilepsy (menni etal. 2001). in contrast to these patients, children with diabetesare usually older and recover from severe hypoglycaemicattacks without permanent major neurological deﬁcits(tupola et al. 1998). however, transient hemiplegia aftersevere hypoglycaemia has been described in children withdiabetes (lala et al. 1989, wayne et al. 1990). the mechanismof this neurological deﬁcit remains unclear. in our study, the neurocognitive functioning of the chil- dren with diabetes and without an experience of severehypoglycaemia was less affected than that of those withrecurrent severe hypoglycaemia. however, they too hadslightly poorer auditory–verbal skills than the unaffected 266 developmental medicine & child neurology 2003, 45: 262–268*us usage:

they differed in a task requiring execu- tive processes. thus, diabetes can be associated with subtle,diffuse deﬁcits in the child’s performance. the explanationcould lie in the mild symptomatic or asymptomatic hypogly-caemic episodes which all children with diabetes experience.such episodes cause transient cognitive deﬁcits, especially inplanning and cognitive ﬂexibility, sustained attention, andreaction time (ryan et al. 1990) and, cumulatively, may have anegative effect on the child’s performance. minor problems in neurocognitive functioning may cause learning difﬁculties at school. ryan (1988) reported poorerschool achievement among children with diabetes, especial-ly in reading and spelling. in our study, the children with dia-betes and especially those who had experienced severehypoglycaemia had more learning difﬁculties reported byparents and needed more part-time special education thanthe unaffected children. a limitation of the study is that teach-ers’ reports were not obtained. in the literature, there is noconsensus regarding the link between speciﬁc learning disor-ders and diabetes. when compared with other groups of chil-dren with chronic illnesses, children with diabetes performmore poorly at school and surpass only those children with aneurological illness e.g. epilepsy (fowler et al. 1985). deﬁcitsin neurocognitive functioning apart, other reasons can beadduced to explain the poorer school achievement of childrenwith diabetes. they may be more frequently absent fromschool, which can affect school performance. mild hypogly-caemic episodes have an inﬂuence on attention (ryan et al.1990, gschwend et al. 1995), psychomotor speed and mem-ory (reich et al. 1990), and learning in the classroom is notalways effective. it is likely that teachers are not always awareof hypoglycaemia-induced cognitive deﬁcits, and this mayalso inﬂuence performance at school. the limitations of the current study are acknowledged. we have used a small sample, and this restricts the generalizabil-ity of the results. nevertheless, some signiﬁcant differencesin neurocognitive functioning between the groups werefound. most of the previous studies on the effects of diabeteson cognitive functioning have found that the critical factorsaffecting cognitive development in children are early onset ofdiabetes (ryan et al. 1985, rovet et al. 1988, hagen et al. 1990)and prevalence of severe hypoglycaemia (rovet et al. 1987,bjørgaas et al. 1997). however, according to kaufman and col-leagues (1999) age of diagnosis is not related to neurocogni-tive test results. in our study, the children who had had severehypoglycaemia were diagnosed at a younger age than theother children with diabetes. this is quite often the case, asyoung children have a higher incidence of severe hypogly-caemia (ternand et al. 1982). it remains doubtful, however,whether the onset age of diabetes or the occurrence of severehypoglycaemia at a certain age affects cognitive development.because of the small size of the sample, the present study can-not fully differentiate the effects of the age at onset of illnessand severe hypoglycaemia. in children with diabetes, neurocognitive functioning is in most cases normally developed, but diffuse deﬁcits mayalso exist. clinically signiﬁcant impairments are associatedwith severe hypoglycaemia. deﬁcits in cognitive functioningin turn have an important effect on the child’s performance,on school achievement as well as on the child’s ability tomanage diabetes. this study suggests that neuropsychologi-cal assessments should be administered to children withdiabetes in order to identify possible deﬁcits in neurocognitive functioning. doi: 10.1017/s0012162203000501 accepted for publication 23rd october

(1986, 1987) suggested that the relationship between type 1 diabetes and dyslexia may be due to a genetic connection between chromosomes 6 and 15. the hla complex on chromosome 6 is involved in the susceptibility to type 1 diabetes (e.g., field et al. 1986; field 1989). smith et al. ( 1983) reported significant lod score evidence for linkage between dyslexia transmitted in an appar- ent autosomal dominant fashion, and a chromo- some 15 centromeric heteromorphism, although subsequent researchers (e.g., bisgaard et al. 1987) have failed to replicate these findings. smith and colleagues (smith et al. 1989, 1991) also reported evidence suggesting a linkage between the hla region on chromosome 6 and dyslexia, which is particularly relevant to the possible relationship with type 1 diabetes. they also suggested the possibility of genetic heterogeneity, since some families with positive chromosome 6 lod scores showed no evidence for chromosome 15 linkage and vice versa. the studies of type 1 diabetes and dyslexia by hansen et al. (1986, 1987) were compromised by three problems. first, the definition of dyslexia, in terms of assessment tools or cutoff scores, was absent from these articles, so that the prevalence data that they obtained cannot be compared with any other published estimates. second, families with diabetes were ascertained through probands in a diabetes hospital, who, the investigators rea- soned, were most likely to be insulin-dependent. the frequency of “diabetes” which they found in the relatives of these probands was, however, quite high, suggesting that those relatives might have included some individuals with non-insulin-depen- dent diabetes. third, no control families were stud- ied, so it is impossible to determine whether the frequency of dyslexia which they obtained with 74 s. g. crawford et al. heredifas 122 (1995) their diagnostic criteria was decreased in the sub- jects with diabetes relative to the general popula- tion, or increased in the nondiabetic relatives. an association between dyslexia and type 1 diabetes could provide important information about the genetic basis of each disorder. for all of these reasons, we explored this topic further, con- trolling for the impact of environment by studying siblings. rather than deciding a priori to focus on a specific type of learning problem such as dyslexia, we performed a broad assessment of cog- nitive skills and some motor skills in children with type i diabetes and their unaffected siblings. based on the reports of hansen et al. (1986, 1987), it was hypothesized that the unaffected sib- lings would show significantly more deficits in cog- nitive and motor skills than would the children with type 1 diabetes. subjects and methods to be potential subjects, children with type i diabetes had to have at least one unaffected sibling, and had to have been recently diagnosed with type 1 diabetes (between 1987 and 1990). subjects had to have developed type 1 diabetes after the age of five, because of other reports of cognitive deficits in children whose type 1 diabetes developed before five years of age (rovet et al. 1987; ryan et al. 1985). the diabetes clinic at the alberta chil- dren’s hospital sent out introductory letters to families of children with type 1 diabetes on the current caseload. this letter gave a brief explana- tion about the project, and included a form and a self-addressed stamped envelope for the parents to return to the research team if they agreed to receive a telephone call to hear more about the study. in total, 37 parents returned the form. of those 37 replies, 22 familes eventually agreed to participate in the study, 12 families refused to participate (primarily because of the time required), and three families contained children who were either too young or too old to participate. the response rate was somewhat low; however, the clinic personnel led us to expect a response rate in this range because their patients with type 1 diabetes have been very intensively studied in the past few years. families were also recruited through family physicians in two other cities. from the 11 families who replied to introductory letters, five agreed to participate in the study, three refused, and three families had children who were not appropriate for the study because they had developed type 1 dia- betes before the age of five. subjects were 27 sibling pairs, aged 6 to 20 years. one child in each pair had type 1 diabetes, and the other child was the sibling closest in age to the child with type 1 diabetes. none of the siblings of the diabetic children had type 1 diabetes. there were 16 females and 11 males with type 1 diabetes (mean age = 12.44 years, sd = 3.01), and 10 fe- male siblings and i7 male siblings (mean age = 12.12 years, sd=3.71). it was not possible to match children with type 1 diabetes to their un- affected siblings on the basis of sex because of the fact that the majority of families either had only two children, or had only one other child between the ages of 6 and 20 years. all participants and/or their parents provided written confirmation of their voluntary consent. the study was approved by the conjoint medical ethics committee of the university of calgary, and by the alberta children’s hospital research committee. psychoeducational and motor assessment. - chil- dren were assessed using the wechsler intelligence scale for children revised (wisc-r; wechsler 1974), the reading, mathematics, and written lan- guage achievement subtests from the woodcock johnson psychoeducational battery (woodcock and johnson 1977), the bilateral coordination subtest from the bruininks oseretsky test of mo- tor proficiency (botmp; bruininks 1978), and the weiss comprehensive articulation test (wcat; weiss 1980), as listed in table 1. two subjects who were over the age of 17 were given the wechsler adult intelligence scale-revised (wais-r; wechsler 1981). the bilateral coordi- nation subtest of the botmp was used in the assessment because problems in this area have been found to co-exist with dyslexia ( regehr and kaplan 1988). the wcat was used because of some pilot data we had collected which suggested that unaffected siblings of children with type 1 diabetes had more speech problems than did the children with type 1 diabetes. parent’s questionnaire. - one parent of each child completed a questionnaire on the child’s personal history and any familial history of learning difficulties (e.g., hyperactivity, reading problems), immune disorders (e.g., allergies, asthma) and au- toimmune disorders (e.g., rheumatoid arthritis). the medical history questionnaire and scoring protocol from burke et al.

(1988), 0.50 points was awarded for each parent and/or sibling who was nonrighthanded, 0.25 points for each blood rela- tive of the child who was nonrighthanded. one point was awarded if the child was reported to exhibit any degree of nonrighthandedness, which was broadly defined as any score greater than zero on the handedness scale. an overall index of famil- ial nonrighthandedness was generated by adding together the points awarded for nonrighthand- edness in the child, parents, siblings, and blood relatives. the 10-item abbreviated symptom question- naire (asq; cowers 1973) was also included in the questionnaire, as an indicator of children who might have some of the characteristics of attention deficit hyperactivity disorder (adhd). the asq has been established to be a valid and reliable measure for identifying adhd (conners 1973; rosenberg et al. 1989), although reliance on it for the diagnosis of adhd has been criticized by many (e.g., ullman et al. 1985), particularly with respect to the way researchers have used cutoff scores to define hyperactive samples. thus, we made no further attempt to establish a clinical diagnosis (e.g., via the use of cutoff scores), but instead, we used the asq to identify parental concerns associated with adhd. the final section of the questionnaire asked about pregnancy and birth complications (e.g., toxemia, caesarian section, cyanosis, jaundice) 16015223, 1995, 1, downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1601-5223.1995.00073.x by test, wiley online library on [13/01/2025]. see the terms and conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on wiley online library for rules of use;

however, there was a significant sex difference (wilk’s lambda f(3,47) = 6.19, p < 0.01). girls performed significantly better in reading skills (f( 1,49) = 4.93, p < 0.05), and in written language skills (f( 1,49) = 11.86, p < 0.01). scores on the woodcock johnson psychoeduca- tional battery were also examined to determine whether any met the conventional definition of learning difficulties. using a two-year delay as our criterion, we calculated 162 discrepancy scores, based on chronological age at testing and age- equivalent scores (reading, mathematics, and writ- ten language for each of the 54 children). only five children were found to have at least a two-year delay in one or more of the areas examined. four of the five children had type 1 diabetes, and of those four, two were significantly delayed in writ- ten language, one was delayed in both written language and reading, and one was delayed only in reading. one of the siblings had a two-year delay in mathematics skills. the two groups were not significantly different in terms of their discrepancy scores (p > 0.05); however, the overall effect for sex approached significance (wilk’s lambda f( 3,47) = 6.07, p < 0.10). girls performed signifi- cantly better and had significantly higher discrep- ancy scores on written language skills (f( 1,49) = 6.07, p < 0.05). there were also no significant group differences on the measure of speech articulation (p > 0.05), and on the measure of bilateral coordination (p > 0.05) parent’s questionnaire chi-square tests of independence were used to compare the children with type 1 diabetes and their siblings in terms of various learning diffi- culties and immunologic diseases. the children with type 1 diabetes were not significantly differ- ent (p > 0.05) from their siblings in the prevalence of learning or attention problems. similarly, no significant group differences emerged in the preva- lence of nonrighthandedness or immunologic dis- orders (p > 0.05). a manova was conducted using the overall indices of pregnancy and birth complications, the mother’s weight gain, the child’s birth weight, and the number of days premature/postmature as the dependent variables. no significant differences emerged (p > 0.05). a number of chi-square tests of independence were conducted comparing the children with type 1 diabetes and their siblings in terms of the individual pregnancy and birth com- plications. no significant differences emerged (p > 0.05). 16015223, 1995, 1, downloaded from https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/doi/10.1111/j.1601-5223.1995.00073.x by test, wiley online library on [13/01/2025]. see the terms and conditions (https://onlinelibrary.wiley.com/terms-and-conditions) on wiley online library for rules of use;

(1986, 1987) suggested that type 1 diabetes and dyslexia could be due to the same dominantly inherited genetic susceptibility, and that an environmental factor possibly acting in utero could elicit dyslexia, which in turn would protect against later development of type 1 diabetes. if this were the case, it would be expected that the un- affected siblings of children with type 1 diabetes would show significant deficits in cognitive skills related to language. the results of the present study showed that, contrary to the initial hypothesis, there were no differences between the unaffected siblings and the children with type 1 diabetes on any of the cognitive skills that were assessed. one concern is whether our sample size afforded us significant power to detect the differences re- ported by hansen and colleagues. they found a 27 yo rate of dyslexia in family members: a com- parable rate in our sample would have revealed a minimum of seven siblings affected by dyslexia, indicating our sample size was sufficient. in reality, we found no siblings with significant reading deficits. when we used a two-year delay as a criterion for learning problems, five of the 54 chil- dren had at least a two-year delay in reading, mathematics, and/or written language. four of those five children had type 1 diabetes, which is contrary to the initial hypothesis. this 10 % preva- lence of school problems was approximately what would be expected in any population sample. thus, the results of the present study have failed to replicate the findings of hansen et al. (1986, 1987). even though we used a broad assessment of cognitive skills, and even though we used un- affected siblings as controls, no significant group differences emerged. hansen et al. (1986, 1987) also argued that the relationship between type 1 diabetes and dyslexia is in fact a case of pleiotropism, which occurs when certain genetic predispositions manifest themselves in diverse ways in different members of the same family (borecki et al. 1985). the fact that we found no relationship between type 1 diabetes and dyslexia may indicate that type 1 diabetes and learning difficulties like dyslexia may be related within members of the extended family (as studied sample size, our investigation of this topic was better controlled than those of hansen et al. our sample was sufficient to confirm other known char- acteristics of cognitive skills: we found the expected female superiority for language skills, and we found that approximately 10 % of the sample had a two-year delay in reading, written language, or mathematics. the fact that we found no support for a relationship between any language skills and type 1 diabetes with subjects matched for environ- ment (sibling pairs) and assessed with standardized tests of cognitive skills, suggests that the relation- ship is nonexistent or very weak at best. acknowledgements. -this research was funded by the alberta mental health research fund, and the alberta children's hospi- tal foundation. references bisgaard, m. l., eiberg, h., mqller, n., niebuhr, e. and mohr, j. 1987. dyslexia and chromosome 15 heteromorphism: negative lod score in danish material. - clin. genet. 32 118- 119 borecki, 1. b., rao, d. c., lalouel, j. m., mcgue, m. and gerrard, j. w. 1985. demonstration of a common major gene with pleiotropic effects on immunoglobulin e levels and allergy. - genet. epidemiol. 2: 327-338 bruininks, r. h. 1978. bruininks-oseretsky test of motor proficiency. - circle pines, minnesota, american guidance services, inc. burke, h. l., yeo, r. a., vranes, l., garry, p. j. and goodwin, j. s. 1988. handedness, developmental disorders, and in vivo and in vitro measurements of immune re- sponses. ~ deu. neuropsychol. 4: 103-1 15 conners, c. k. 1973. rating scale for use in drug studies with children. - psychopharmacol. bull. 9 24-29 crovitz, h. f. and zener, k. 1962. a group-test for assessing hand- and eye-dominance. -am. j. psycho/. 75 271-276 field, l. l. 1988. invited editorial: insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, a model for the study of multifactorial disorders. - am. j. hum. genet. 43: 793-798 field, l. l. 1989. gene predisposing to iddm in multiplex families. - genet. epidemiol. 6 101-106 field, l. l., fothergill-payne, c., bertrams, j. and baur, m. p. 1986. hla-dr effects in a larger german iddm dataset. - genet. epidemiol. suppl. 1: 323-328 hansen, o., nerup, j. and holbek, b. 1986. common genetic origin of specific dyslexia and insulin-dependent diabetes melli- tus?

ori gi nal ar tic le203 abs tract objective: to evaluate the effects of diabetic ketoacidosis (dka) on neurocognitive functions in children and adolescents presenting with new- onset type 1 diabetes. methods: newly diagnosed patients were divided into two groups: those with dka and those without dka (non-dka). following metabolic stabilization, the patients took a mini-mental status exam prior to undergoing a baseline battery of cognitive tests that evaluated visual and verbal cognitive tasks. follow-up testing was performed 8-12 weeks after diagnosis. patients completed an iq test at follow-up. results: there was no statistical difference between the dka and non-dka groups neither in alertness at baseline testing nor in an iq test at follow-up. the dka group had significantly lower baseline scores than the non-dka group for the visual cognitive tasks of design recognition, design memory and the composite visual memory index (vmi). at follow-up, design recognition remained statistically lower in the dka group, but the design memory and the vmi tasks returned to statistical parity between the two groups. no significant differences were found in verbal cognitive tasks at baseline or follow-up between the two groups. direct correlations were present for the admission co 2 and the visual cognitive tasks of vmi, design memory and design recognition. direct correlations were also present for admission ph and vmi, design memory and picture memory. conclusion: pediatric patients presenting with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes and severe but uncomplicated dka showed a definite trend for lower cognitive functioning when compared to the age-matched patients without dka. key words: diabetic ketoacidosis, cognition, dehydration, neuroinflammation conflict of interest:

associated with varying degrees of diminished cognitive function, frequently involving memory, but also the subcategories of other neuropsychological domains (1,2). studies have not always demonstrated differences in academic performance when children with type 1 diabetes are compared to siblings or classmates, suggesting that cognitive deficiencies may be subtle (3). while the pathogenesis of cognitive decline in patients with type 1 diabetes is not well understood, the pathogenesis is likely multifactorial based on numerous potential perturbators that are present during the crisis of diabetic ketoacidosis (dka). early age of onset (4), chronic hyperglycemia based on hemoglobin a1c (hba1c) (5), the presence of microvascular disease (6) and decreased white matter volume have been associated with cognitive deficits (7). diagnosis before the age seven is associated with structural and functional changes in the brain (7). studies vary regarding the relationship between significant hypoglycemia in type 1 diabetic children/adolescents and a deleterious effect on cognition (8). dka is an acute metabolic and immunologic crisis that occurs in approximately 25 percent of children in the united states with new-onset type 1 diabetes (9). this life-threatening emergency results from a deficiency of insulin and insulin resistance, systemically (10) and in the brain (11). in addition, the endocrine/metabolic decompensation of dka involves an increase in the counter-regulatory hormones (12), resulting in progressive hyperglycemia, hyperosmolar dehydration

increased secretion of cortisol, a counter-regulatory hormone and potential neurotoxin, increases the prevalence of cognitive impairment in depression (15), an under-recognized co-morbidity of type 1 diabetes in children and adolescents (16). glucocorticoid-mediated, reduced hippocampal neurogenesis and decreased cognitive function have been reported in the streptozotocin (stz) rat (17). of importance, the reduced hippocampal neurogenesis in stz mice can be reversed by antidepressant treatment (18). also, a positive correlation of c-reactive protein (crp) with depression, unrelated to type 1 diabetes, in children and adolescents supports an interaction of emotional stress, systemic inflammation and neuroinflammation (19). in addition to a neurotoxic effect of glucocorticoids, support for the physiologic stress of dka and its treatment is also associated with a systemic increase of crp (20) thus supporting roles for both physiologic and psychological stress in the pathogenesis of cognition and depression. a recent cross-sectional retrospective study using a computer version of published tasks reported that type 1 diabetic children and adolescents who had a history of uncomplicated [no clinical cerebral edema (ce)] dka scored lower in cognitive memory tasks of both immediate event-spatial position and event-color associations compared to an age-matched group without a history of dka (21). in another cross-sectional retrospective study, children with type 1 diabetes were tested two to four weeks after either dka or hypoglycemia, using the stanford-binet (fourth edition) and recordings of event-related potential tests and were compared to age-and sex-matched control children without type 1 diabetes. this dka group also had a cognitive deficit (22). in this study, we aimed to investigate the contribution of dka to the neurocognitive changes observed in children with type 1 diabetes. to avoid the uncertainties of retrospective information and its potential influence in the pathogenesis of cognitive deficits caused by: 1) the degree and duration of hyperglycemia; 2) the frequency/degree of hypoglycemia; 3) potential contribution of macro-and microangiopathic changes in long-term diabetes; and 4) the comorbidity of depression, we conducted this study in newly diagnosed children and adolescents presenting with and without dka and prospectively administered a standard and well-validated neurocognitive test battery at two points in time. this test battery evaluated: visual planning and memory, verbal memory and expressive language. the primary outcome was the difference in cognitive function based on this test battery . methods patients between the ages of 7 and 18 years presenting to the north carolina children’s hospital with new-onset type 1 diabetes were considered for participation. exclusion criteria included non-english speaking patients or parents (testing materials were printed in english), chronic medication use (except hormone replacement with levothyroxine), developmental delay, learning difficulties or neuropsychological conditions as reported by parents. fourteen patients were invited to participate between november 2011 and december 2012. dka was managed by the pediatric intensive care unit per usual protocol, including intravenous insulin and fluid hydration. the study protocol was approved by institutional review board. patients assented to the study along with parents’ consent. all procedures performed in studies involving human participants were in accordance with the ethical standards of the institutional and/or national research committee and with the 1964 helsinki declaration and its later amendments or comparable ethical standards. the initial cognitive tests were performed prior to hospital discharge. if dka was present, initial testing occurred at least 24 hours after dka resolution (defined as ph≥7.32 and co 2≥18 meq/l) and transfer to the pediatric ward. follow-up testing (t2) was eight to twelve weeks after the diagnosis of type 1 diabetes during a follow-up visit to the pediatric diabetes clinic. this follow-up testing battery consisted of the same cognitive tasks administered at the initial testing as well as a shortened measure of intelligence using the wechsler abbreviated scale of intelligence (wasi-iq). measurements and instruments blood chemistries were collected on admission for each patient. blood glucose was monitored prior to cognitive tests that were administered in the morning when possible. patients completed a one-hour testing battery administered by a psychologist. the initial testing battery consisted of a mini-mental status exam (mmse) to evaluate for alertness prior to other testing. this was followed by standard neurocognitive tests of visual and verbal cognitive tasks. the visual planning and memory tasks used the following instruments: a) wide range assessment of memory and learning, second edition (wraml-2) for design memory, design recognition, picture memory and visual memory index (vmi); b) stanford-binet for bead memory, c) wechsler intelligence scale for children-iv (wisc-iv) for forward spatial span and backward spatial span and d) delis kaplan executive function system (dkefs) for design fluency . the verbal memory and expressive language tasks used: a) wide range assessment of memory and learning, second edition for verbal learning, verbal learning recall and verbal learning recognition; b) wisc-iv for digit span; and c) dkefs for verbal fluency, with subtests of letter fluency and category switching. statistical analysis standard scores and composite scores were determined for the dka and the non-dka groups. a mann-whitney u test of group medians was used to test for statistical differences jessup ab et al. diabetic ketoacidosis and neurocognition 205 between the dka and non-dka group’s demographics and admission values for hba1c, heart rate (hr) for degree of dehydration, ph, bicarbonate (co 2); mmse at baseline cognitive testing and wasi-iq at follow-up cognitive testing. statistical differences between the two groups at baseline and follow-up testing on the cognitive tasks for visual and verbal variables were established using mann-whitney u test of group medians. effect size differences (es-d) for dka and non-dka across the cognitive tasks for the baseline and follow-up testing were also calculated. chi-square analysis was used to identify association between cognitive task score changes from baseline to follow-up and dka/non-dka patient status. correlations were calculated between cognitive tasks measured at baseline (t1) with chemistries obtained at admission and between cognitive tasks at baseline or follow-up (t2) with pre-test blood glucose. results all patients had uneventful recoveries. no patient required mannitol for ce or experienced blood glucose (bg) <70 mg/ dl during hospitalization. three of 14 invited patients declined to participate. three of the four patients with dka and five of the seven patients without dka completed follow-up testing. patients with dka underwent baseline testing 29-34 hours after dka resolution. patients’ admission parameters and demographics are in table 1. the dka group presented with median labs at diagnosis consistent with dka. median hr in the dka group was significantly higher than in the non-dka group: (u=25, p=0.0472). neither group reached the clinically significant brief-global executive composite (gec) score of 70, which is suggestive of lower executive functioning. table 2 shows mean (standard deviation) and median (range) of the standard scores of all cognitive tasks at baseline (t1) and follow-up (t2) testing. at baseline, the dka group scored lower on several visual tasks compared to the group without dka. at follow-up, design recognition in the dka group remained statistically lower than the non-dka group; all of the other visual tasks achieved or maintained statistical parity between the two groups. there were no significant differences between the dka and non-dka groups at baseline or follow-up testing for any of the verbal tasks (table 2). the correlation determinations (table 3) show statistically significant direct relationships between jessup ab et al. diabetic ketoacidosis and neurocognition table 1.

ab et al. diabetic ketoacidosis and neurocognition several admission chemistries and baseline measurements of both visual and verbal cognitive tasks. correlations at baseline testing of both visual and verbal cognitive tasks with pre-test bgs indicate inverse correlations. at follow-up, the visual cognitive task of picture memory maintains its inverse correlation with pre-test bg. last, chi-square analysis for association of the number of cognitive score that increases between baseline and follow-up showed a significant association (χ 2=3.472, p=0.0312) for the dka group. similarly, the cognitive variables, vmi and digit span, had significant inverse correlations with the dka group (r=-0.6635, p=0.0260 and r=-0.7221, p=0.0121, respectively), meaning that lower cognitive scores correlate with the dka group. discussion this is the first prospective study to report acute cognitive deficits in newly diagnosed children and adolescents with type 1 diabetes following correction of uncomplicated (no clinical ce) dka. our data support a neuronal insult during the metabolic and immunologic crisis of dka and/or its treatment that results in acute and possibly long-term cognitive deficits. we recorded statistically lower median baseline (t1) task scores in three of the eight visual cognitive tasks tested in the newly diagnosed dka group in comparison to an age-matched newly diagnosed non-dka group. whether the improvement in design memory and vmi scores three months (t2) after the correction of dka are final new baselines is unknown, since the follow-up tasks were performed at a time when brain remodeling was possibly occurring (23). these longitudinal results differ from the retrospective, cross-sectional, solitary time point studies that reported color and position associations in children and adolescents with a history of dka that were believed to indicate permanent cognitive deficits (21). in contrast, the follow-up (t2) testing of the median task score for design recognition in the dka group decreased further from the baseline; however, for the non-dka group, the score remained constant. this is in keeping with previous speculation that the neurotoxic milieu of dka initiates a greater insult than cognitive deficit with only hyperglycemia. a pattern of decreasing cognition with time is also in keeping with the proton-magnetic resonance spectroscopy (mrs) study of recurrent episodes of dka in a teenage patient, where the naa/cr ratio (neuronal insult) decreased during each dka treatment, followed by a lesser recovery after correction of the second episode of dka; cognitive testing was not reported (24). the combined admission co 2 and ph of the dka and non-dka groups versus the t1 results of the visual and verbal cognitive tasks (table 3) showed significant direct correlation with six baseline tasks; design recognition, design memory, picture memory and vmi as did verbal learning and category fluency . these correlations are in keeping with the association of an acute neuronal insult in close proximity to the t1 cognitive tasks and also supportive of the direct correlation between the admission level of consciousness and admission ph at the time of dka (25). however, it should be noted that we found no correlation between the glasgow coma score and cognitive testing, nor a difference between the mini-alertness tests prior to cognitive testing of the dka and non-dka groups. in addition, the visual tasks of bead memory, picture memory and vmi and the verbal task of digit span had an inverse correlation with the pre-test (t1) bg. an inverse correlation was also present for picture memory and the pre-test (t2) bg. this inverse pre-test bg correlation with cognitive tasks table 3. statistically significant

statistically significant, it is important to note that there was a large difference (effect size=2.5) between the admission hba1c in our dka and non-dka groups suggesting that the cases with dka had longer and/or more severe hyperglycemia at the time of testing. however, no correlation was found between hba1c levels and cognitive testing in our study . in addition, there was no difference in the hba1c pre-test values of dka and non-dka groups in the study by ghetti et al (21). although the pathogenesis of the cognitive deficiencies associated with dka requires further study, it has been reported that ketone bodies, by-products of metabolic dysregulation, are capable in-vitro of differentially perturbating cerebral capillary endothelial cells (ccec) (26) and the increased release of vasoactive peptides such as endothelin-1 (et-1) (27) and vascular endothelial growth factor (vegf) (28) that negatively impacts cognition. hyperlipoproteinemia (29) and toxic tryptophan catabolites (30) are additional by-products of dka metabolic dysregulation and its treatment and thus candidates to affect cognition. also, 3-deoxyglucosone (31) and methylgloxal (32), the highly reactive carbonyl compounds and neurotoxins, are precursors of advanced glycation end-products (age) that increase during treatment and up-regulate the inflammatory milieu of dka (33). these by-products are unlikely to be the sole candidates of neuronal insult/deficit since the milieu in children and adolescents with severe dka also increases systemic and cerebral oxidative stress (34,35), sir (36) and a likely neuronal insult. systemic inflammatory cytokines, activation of the complement cascade including c5b-9, the membrane attack complex (37) and crp (20) are part of the innate immune response activated by dka that increases during treatment. evidence for an acute neuronal insult by oxidative stress and inflammatory peptides is the immune cytochemistry (icc) study of autopsied brains of adolescents with type 1 diabetes, where death occurred due to dka/ce. these cases had histories of chronic poor diabetic control and poor school performance along with significant cerebral expression of oxidative/nitrosative stress and lipid peroxidation (35), as well as an acute inflammatory insult, based on glial and ccec activation, expression of inflammatory peptides and neuronal deficits (11,38,39). it is important to recognize that the neurotoxic immune phenotype in the brains with fatal dka/ce is similar not only to the sir of clinical dka (36,37), but it also develops over time in type 1 diabetic rodent models, without the acute metabolic and immunologic insults of dka and the occurrence of ce (40). the latter is in keeping with hood et al’s clinical study (41) and thus dka and ce do not appear to be prerequisites for neuronal and cognitive deficits, but rather additional severe insults. a sustained cognitive injury is also suggested based on: 1) the infrequent reports of immediate cognitive deficits following severe dka (23); 2) the extended and increased systemic concentration of inflammatory cytokines even after correction of dka (36); 3) the decreased density of neuroprotective gh and igf-1 neuronal receptors in various brain regions including the hippocampus in dka/ce (11,38,39), a region that is important for the formation and retrieval of numerous memory systems. the neuroinflammatory phenotype in the bb/w type 1 diabetic rat (40); and perhaps most importantly; 4) the activation of the age/receptor for advanced glycation end products (rage), an amplifier and perpetuator of oxidative stress and dysregulation of inflammatory pathways in the brain with or without dka (39,40). a progressive and sustained cognitive injury also supports; 5) the observation that children whose dka was in the more distant past had a poorer memory performance (21). limitations of this study are the small sample size, the short duration of follow-up and the absence of testing non-diabetic children and adolescents. strengths of the study are that: 1) it is a prospective study involving patients of comparable ages with newly diagnosed type 1 diabetes with and without dka; 2) it eliminates the confounding factors of hypoglycemia and microvascular disease; 3) it uses standardized cognitive testing; 4) it reports short-term follow-up testing; 5) it extends our insight into the subtleties of the early cognitive deficits in young patients with new-onset type 1 diabetes and dka; and 6) it shows the importance of longitudinal testing. understanding the physiological and functional changes that accompany dka may contribute to early detections of brain changes associated with dka, prior to the onset of chronic debilitating effects of type 1 diabetes and may inform about the mechanisms associated with subsequent cognitive decline. modalities to study the effect of diabetes on the brain have evolved over the years and provide new opportunities not only to examine the impact of dka on neurocognitive dysfunction but also to understand the underlying mechanisms. therefore, further studies in larger populations using new static and functional neuroimaging tools are needed. nevertheless, this study serves to encourage the careful follow-up, preferably in a coordinated care setting, of all children/adolescents with type 1 diabetes, especially those who have had dka. whether routine neurocognitive testing can be recommended in children with type 1 diabetes as part of their follow-up is an important question that remains to be answered. acknowledgements the authors are grateful to drs. edythe wiggs (nih/ ninds), anders a. sima (wayne state school of medicine), 209 jessup ab et al. diabetic ketoacidosis and

and the scottish renal registry importance type 1 diabetes has historically been associated with a significant reduction in life expectancy. major advances in treatment of type 1 diabetes have occurred in the past 3decades. contemporary estimates of the effect of type 1 diabetes on life expectancy areneeded. objective to examine current life expectancy in people with and without type 1 diabetes in scotland. we also examined whether any loss of life expectancy in patients with type 1diabetes is confined to those who develop kidney disease. design, setting, and participants prospective cohort of all individuals alive in scotland with type 1 diabetes who were aged 20 years or older from 2008 through 2010 and were in anationwide register (n=24 691 contributing 67 712 person-years and 1043 deaths). main outcomes and measures differences in life expectancy between those with and those without type 1 diabetes and the percentage of the difference due to various causes. results life expectancy at an attained age of 20 years was an additional 46.2 years among men with type 1 diabetes and 57.3 years among men without it, an estimated loss in lifeexpectancy with diabetes of 11.1 years (95% ci, 10.1-12.1). life expectancy from age 20 yearswas an additional 48.1 years among women with type 1 diabetes and 61.0 years amongwomen without it, an estimated loss with diabetes of 12.9 years (95% ci, 11.7-14.1). evenamong those with type 1 diabetes with an estimated glomerular filtration rate of 90ml/min/1.73 m 2or higher, life expectancy was reduced (49.0 years in men, 53.1 years in women) giving an estimated loss from age 20 years of 8.3 years (95% ci, 6.5-10.1) for menand 7.9 years (95% ci, 5.5-10.3) for women. overall, the largest percentage of the estimatedloss in life expectancy was related to ischemic heart disease (36% in men, 31% in women) butdeath from diabetic coma or ketoacidosis was associated with the largest percentage of theestimated loss occurring before age 50 years (29.4% in men, 21.7% in women). conclusions and relevance estimated life expectancy for patients with type 1 diabetes in scotland based on data from 2008 through 2010 indicated an estimated loss of lifeexpectancy at age 20 years of approximately 11 years for men and 13 years for womencompared with the general population without type 1 diabetes. jama .

wecannotdirectlyassesswhetherlifeexpectancyorthe loss in life expectancy has improved with type 1 diabetesbecause we do not have historical life expectancy data forour population. indeed, previous studies of any populationare sparse, and none have covered the full type 1 diabetespopulation of a country. goodkin 3reported that the loss in life expectancy with type 1 diabetes was 27 years in 10 538applicants for life insurance to a company in the unitedstates observed from 1951 to 1971. estimates by type of dia-betes or by attained age were not given but in those withonset occurring before the age of 15 years, the loss in lifeexpectancy was 27 years. in an analysis of a diabetes register covering canterbury, new zealand, spanning from 1984through 1993, the remaining life expectancy at an attainedage of 20 years for those with diabetes onset before the ageof 30 years was about 40 years as compared with about 47years for the combined sexes in our study with a loss in lifeexpectancy of 17 years. 4compared with these earlier esti- mates, but in different populations, our report shows agreater life expectancy at attained age of 20 years and asmaller loss in a life expectancy compared with the generalpopulation. however, whether these study populations are sufficientlysimilartoourstomakecomparisonoflifeexpec-tancy appropriate is uncertain. the difference we found wasalso much lower than what is currently generally cited. forexample, the diabetes uk website has until now cited a lossofabout20yearsassociatedwithtype1diabetes,althoughitis not specified from what attained age. 18 our results differ substantially from a recent report from the pittsburgh edc and allegheny county registry on lifeexpectancy in type 1 diabetes. 5in that study, approximately 2000 people with diagnosis dates spanning 1950 to 1980werefollowedupto2009.therewere325recordeddeathsinthe pittsburgh edc. the life expectancy at the attained

to1980.becauseourdatareflectamorerecentperiodthanthatstudy, we would expect the life expectancy to be higheramong patients in our study and the loss in life expectancyto be less. this may reflect that we are studying differentpopulations or better outcomes in the type 1 diabetes popu-lation in the united states. however, in that study only 26people in the pittsburgh edc cohort had reached attainedages older than 60 years, so the mortality beyond that waslargely extrapolated. this may also affect the comparison ofthe 2 studies. because our data are based on national record-ing of all deaths from mandatory death certification, we arecertain that the deaths we report in our cohort occurred andcannot be an overestimate. an important question is whether our findings are gen- eralizable internationally. this cannot be directly assessedbecause there are no large contemporary or historicalnationally representative studies from other countries. riskfactor levels, differences in hemoglobin a 1clevels, and risk- factor control among those with type 1 diabetes in scotlandare similar to those in england but somewhat higher thansome european countries and some us cohorts, 9whichcould cause a greater loss of life expectancy in scotland than in those countries. therefore, it would be of interest to seecontemporary larger scale data from the united states andother countries too. such studies should not simply right-censor losses to follow-up but should test the potential sta-tistical effect of such losses being due to death and shouldinclude nationally representative samples of patients withtype 1 diabetes. study limitations there are 2 types of life expectancy estimation: period life expect ancy estimates ,whichwehavecalculated,describethe expected additional years of life or life expectancy that per-tains for people alive today if mortality rates across all agestrata observed today pertained throughout their lives;cohort life e xpect ancyestimates use recent trends in life expectancy to project further improvements in survival inthe future; we did not have enough long-term trend data

expenditure associated with one episode of dkain privately insured u.s. children was calculated to be over$3.500[5]. the incidence of dka at diabetes onset may be due to parents’ unawareness of symptoms of hyperglycaemia.having a first degree relative with diabetes is associatedwith a decreased risk of dka at diabetes. however, thedegree of awareness of diabetes symptoms among medicalcare providers seems to be crucial in dka prevention [6]. ifdiabetes is not diagnosed on the first visit to the physician,the risk of dka increases significantly. other factors suchasinsurance,parentaleducation,distancetodiabetescentre,and aggressive form of diabetes may also influence the riskof dka in children with diabetes. our previous analysisperformed from january 2006

type 1 diabetes mellitus (t1dm) is a major subtype of diabetes and is usually diagnosed at a young age with insulin deﬁciency. the life expectancy of t1dm patients has increased substantially in comparison with that three decadesago due to the availability of exogenous insulin, though it is still shorter than that of healthy people. however, the relationremains unclear between t1dm and dementia as an aging-related disease. we conducted a systematic review of existingliterature on t1dm and cognition impairments by carrying out searches in electronic databases medline, embase, andgoogle scholar. we restricted our review to studies involving only human subjects and excluded studies on type 2 diabetesmellitus or non-classiﬁed diabetes. a meta-analysis was ﬁrst performed on the relationship between t1dm and cognitivechanges in youths and adults respectively. then the review focused on the cognitive complications of t1dm and theirrelation with the characteristics of t1dm, glycemic control, diabetic complications, comorbidities, and others. first, ageat onset, disease duration, and glycemic dysregulation were delineated for their association with cognitive changes. thendiabetic ketoacidosis, angiopathy, and neuropathy were examined as diabetic complications for their involvement in cognitiveimpairments. lastly, body mass index and blood pressure were discussed for their relations with the cognitive changes. futurestudies are needed to elucidate the pathogenesis of t1dm-related cognitive impairments or dementia. keywords: cognitive impairments, diabetic ketoacidosis, microangiopathy, severe hypoglycemia, type 1 diabetes mellitus introduction: t1dm and the risk of dementia as a major subtype of diabetes, type 1 diabetes mellitus (t1dm) accounts for about 5% of all dia-betic cases [1]. the main feature of t1dm is insulindeﬁciency, and patients with t1dm are treated withdifferent types of exogenous insulin (rapid-, short-, ∗correspondence to: dr.

still shorter than that of healthy people, t1dm patients now livemuch longer than they did three decades ago dueto the availability of exogenous insulin [2, 3]; theprolonged life span thus makes them at risk for theaging-related disease: dementia. in one retrospectivestudy, the risk ratio for dementia in hospital-admittedt1dm patients is 1.65 times over the non-diabeticcontrols [4]. however, the study sample is not rep-resentative of the t1dm patient population as mostt1dm patients are on an outpatient insulin treatment issn 1387-2877/17/$35.00 © 2017 – ios press and the authors. all rights

we conducted a systemic review by searching the electronic databases medline, embase, and googlescholar with the following keywords: type 1 dia-betes, insulin-dependent diabetes mellitus, cognitiveimpairment, and dementia. after removing duplicatesand review articles, the original search returned a totalof 310 results. after the abstracts were examined, 215studies were excluded from further analysis as theywere either totally irrelevant ( n= 135) or on type 2 diabetes mellitus ( n= 38), animal models ( n= 13), or non-classiﬁed diabetes ( n= 29). the current review has focused on the 59 original reports published onor after the year of 1990 from the remaining studies(n= 95). cognitive changes in t1dm patients cognitive impairment refers to a continuum of severity from “mild,” which might be noticed by thepatient or healthcare providers, to “severe,” such asdementia, which interferes with activities of daily lifeor disallows a patient to function without assistance.as age is an important factor for cognitive impair-ments, cognitive changes were reviewed separatelyin young or adult t1dm patients based on their ageat the time of neuropsychological assessments. foryoung t1dm patients, the cognitive function or per-formance is presented in table 1. impaired executivefunctions [5] and motor speed task [6] are seen inyoung t1dm patients between 9 years old and 19 years old (table 1). in another study, a worse perfor-mance on visual-spatial ability and memory is shownin pediatric t1dm patients than the control group [7].in addition, lower verbal intelligence is observed inthe young t1dm group than the non-diabetic con-trol group [8, 9] (table 1). however, the associationbetween t1dm and impaired cognitive functions hasnot been observed in other studies. for example,no signiﬁcant difference was found from a prospec-tive study between young adults with early-onsett1dm and controls in general intellectual ability,memory, and emotional difﬁculties [10] (table 1).although students with t1dm had a signiﬁcantlylower academic performance than their non-diabeticclassmates [11] (table 1), they and their unaffectedsiblings had no signiﬁcant differences on measuresof cognitive performance, academic achievement, orspeech ability [12] (table 1). for adult t1dm patients, cognitive impairments were consistently reported from different studies[13–15] (table 2). in one study, the incidence rate ofcognitive impairments was 28% among adult patientswith childhood-onset t1dm compared to 5% inthose without diabetes, though the study had a rel-atively small sample size and only included t1dmcases with a childhood-onset [14]. different types ofcognitive functions are impaired in adult patients witht1dm. for example, the adult t1dm patients havea worse performance in memory than nondiabeticcontrols [16] (table 2). in addition, adult t1dm patients have signiﬁcantly reduced psychomotor efﬁciency [16, 17], sustained table 1 cognitive function changes

functions in concept formation,cognitive ﬂexibility, and anticipation [16] (table 2). age at onset, disease duration, and cognitive impairments t1dm usually has an early age at onset (aao) and is most often diagnosed in children and youngadults; therefore, t1dm is also called juvenile dia-betes. the developing brain might be more vulnerableto the effects of dysglycemia in young t1dm patients[20]. the aao is an important characteristic oft1dm for inﬂuencing cognitive functions in patientswith t1dm. a worse cognitive performance is usu-ally associated with an earlier aao. for example,learning and memory skills are more affected inpediatric t1dm patients with early onset than thosewith late onset [21]. pathologically, more atrophiccerebral structural changes are found in early-onsetthan in late-onset young t1dm patients. moreover,the medial prefrontal regions, insula, and cerebel-lum are the known rapidly developing brain regionsin children, who are signiﬁcantly affected by theearly-onset t1dm [22]. these structural changes ofdecreased gray matter volume might have long-termeffects on the cognitive functions. similarly, current intellectual ability and informa- tion processing ability are poorer in young adults withearly-onset t1dm (<7 years old) than those with late-onset (7–17 years old) t1dm [23]. the fact that thereis more prevalent central brain atrophy in the earlyonset t1dm group than in late-onset t1dm groupsuggests an organic contribution to different cogni-tive performance between the two groups. further,the neurodevelopment in children may be affectedby early-onset diabetes, which might have long-term consequential cognitive deteriorating effects [23]. disease duration is another important character- istic of t1dm, which is inversely associated withcognitive performance. together with aao, diseaseduration has been reported to be strong predictors forimpaired cognition functions in psychomotor speed,memory, processing speed, attention, working mem-ory, verbal ability, general intelligence, and executivefunction in adult t1dm patients [13]. in addition, adelayed recall task performance is inversely relatedto the disease duration [24]. further, disease dura-tion could effectively predict the psychomotor speeddecline in adult patients with t1dm [17]. how-ever, the relationship between disease duration andcognitive changes has to be analyzed by takinginto consideration the age factor. not surprisingly,in one study, cognitive impairments in adolescentt1dm patients were reported to be independent ofboth glycemic control and disease duration, [5], andthe ﬁnding suggested that t1dm might have directpathological effects on cognitive functions. glycemic control in patients with t1dm although different types of exogenous insulin are available for optimizing glycemic control, t1dmpatients could not regulate their glucose metabolismas effectively as a healthy person with the endoge-nous insulin can. ironically, insulin therapy itself isassociated with conditions of either hyperglycemiaor hypoglycemia [25]. for example, insulin treat-ment is shown to be associated with the incidence rateof hypoglycemia in pediatric t1dm patients (9–15years old) [26]. in addition, the glycemic control usu-ally deteriorates along with the increasing duration32 w. li et al. / t1dm and cognitive impairments of t1dm [5]. thus, either hyperglycemia or hypo- glycemia or both are commonly seen in patients witht1dm. hyperglycemia and cognitive changes hyperglycemia can be either chronic or induced acutely by using experimental technologies [27].chronic hyperglycemia is shown to be associatedwith low general cognitive abilities, slow ﬁne motorspeed, and low receptive language function amongpediatric t1dm patients (<6 years old) [28]. spellingperformance is also reduced in the youth witht1dm and with increased exposure to chronic hyper-glycemia in terms of disease duration and level ofhyperglycemia [8]. in adult t1dm patients, poorperformance on psychomotor tasks, slow mental sub-traction speed, and increased subtraction errors areseen as the effects of acute hyperglycemia whenthe blood glucose is above15 mmol/l [29]. in addi-tion, among middle-aged participants with t1dm,cognitive impairments are associated with chronichyperglycemia [14]. although most studies haveshown that the chronic hyperglycemia is associatedwith the cognitive changes in t1dm patients, thesame relationship is not observed on the long-termspatial memory performance in children with t1dm(6–18 years old) [30]. it is worthy to note that aao may interact with hyperglycemia for inﬂuencing cognitive functions int1dm patients. for instance, hyperglycemia is neg-atively correlated with visual-spatial ability in youngt1dm patients, and the correlation is stronger inthese patients with an early aao than in those withlate aao [7]. the level of hyperglycemia is anotherimportant factor for inﬂuencing cognitive functions.for instance, the level of hyperglycemia is negativelyassociated with intelligence and information process-ing speed in pediatric t1dm patients [7]. in addition,a higher hba1c at t1dm diagnosis in young patients(7–17 years old) is associated with a worse perfor-mance on the long-delay spatial delayed responsetask [31] as well as lower psychomotor and mentalefﬁciency in adolescents (13–19 years old) [32]. evenan acute hyperglycemia achieved with a modiﬁedclamp technique is associated with impaired complexcognitive function in children with t1dm [27]. whenblood glucose is in the 20– to 30–mmol/l range, thechildren’s intelligence quotient is reduced by 9.5%.also, hba1c values are negatively associated withdeclines in motor speed and psychomotor efﬁciency, according to another study that involved a mixedage group of t1dm patients (13–39 years old [33]).therefore, the effects of chronic hyperglycemia oncognitive performance are associated with the aaoof t1dm, t1dm duration, or both. hypoglycemia and cognitive functions hypoglycemia, another condition commonly seen in t1dm patients, has been studied for its rela-tionship with cognitive changes as well. attentionﬂexibility [34], spatial ability [35], and speed ofinformation processing [34] are impaired with hypo-glycemia. early visual information processing andcontrast sensitivity are also impaired during hypo-glycemia in adult t1dm patients [36]. in addition,psychomotor speed and reaction speed are sig-niﬁcantly decreased during hypoglycemic episodes(based on home blood glucose readings) for school-aged children [37]. besides the aao, frequency ofhypoglycemia seems to play an important role inthe cognitive changes seen in t1dm patients. forinstance, spatial intelligence and delayed recall arereduced only with repeated hypoglycemic episodes,particularly when those hypoglycemic episodesoccur before the age of 5 [9]. however, the associationbetween hypoglycemia and cognitive impairmentshas not been observed in other reports. for example,verbal intelligence is not lowered by increased expo-sure to hypoglycemia in young t1dm patients (5–17years old) [9], and the number of prior hypoglycemicevents is not associated with any changes in the cogni-tive functions in adult t1dm patients [13]. moreover,sustained attention and intelligence are preserved dur-ing hypoglycemia induced with a hyperinsulineamicglucose clamp in adult t1dm patients [34]. severe hypoglycemia and cognitive functions as the most serious side effect of insulin ther- apy, severe hypoglycemia (sh) affects 30–40% oft1dm patients [33, 38]. the risk of contracting shincreases with unawareness of hypoglycemia as wellas increased glucose variability in adult patients withlong-standing t1dm [39]. sh is deﬁned as hav-ing low blood glucose level that requires the helpof others for the treatment. in addition, patientswith concurrent hypoglycemia (<70 mg/dl butw. li et al. / t1dm and cognitive impairments 33 ≥40 mg/dl) and coma or seizure are also classi- ﬁed as having sh [10]. the association between shand cognitive function changes has not been observedin young t1dm patients. for instance, a history ofsh is not associated with the cognitive decrementsin a t1dm patient group between 13 years old and39 years old in a longitudinal study [40]. more-over, sh is not associated with changes in eitheracademic abilities [8, 21] or any other cognitive func-tions in children with t1dm [41]. furthermore, it isstill debatable how frequency of sh and aao affectthe cognitive functions in t1dm patients [33]. forexample, children with an sh history have more neu-ropsychological impairments than those without it[42]. in addition, high frequency of and early expo-sure to sh in children with t1dm negatively affectsspatial long-term memory performance [9, 30]. nev-ertheless, one study reports that sh does not causecognitive dysfunction in children even with severehypoglycemia occurring during early childhood (<6years old) [43]. by contrast, type 1 diabetic patientswith recurrent sh are shown to have worse cognitivefunctions than those without a history of sh [44, 45]. dka and cognitive functions diabetic ketoacidosis (dka) is a very serious com- plication of t1dm that can lead to coma or death.this condition happens when the body does not haveenough insulin for regulating glucose metabolism andwhen increased ketone production leads to metabolicacidosis. the prevalence rate of dka varies from20.9% to 75% in newly diagnosed t1dm patients,and the average rate is 38.8% [46–53]. the dkais shown to be a risk factor for cognitive impair-ments in patients with t1dm. pediatric patients withnewly diagnosed t1dm and dka show a deﬁnitetrend for having worse cognitive functions than theage-matched t1dm patients without dka [54]. forexample, young t1dm patients with dka at thetime of diabetes diagnosis perform worse on the spa-tial delayed response task than their non-diabeticsibling controls [31]. a history of dka is also cor-related with lower verbal intelligence quotient inchildren with t1dm [55]. in addition, these patientsperform poorly on measures of executive functionwhen they have a positive history of both dka andhyperglycemia [55]. so the glycemic control is prob-ably interacting with dka to worsen the cognitiveperformance. however, a history of dka is not asso-ciated with either decreased academic abilities or anincreased risk of learning problems in children or young t1dm patients in other studies [8, 21]. theeffects of dka, as well as its interaction with aao,disease duration, and glycemic control, are yet to beinvestigated. angiopathy and cognitive functions angiopathy in t1dm patients can be manifested as either microangiopathy or macroangiopathy or both.retinopathy and nephropathy belong to microan-giopathic complications of t1dm and are twocommon forms of diabetic microangiopathy, whichhas been suggested to be associated with cogni-tive impairments in patients with t1dm. besideshyperglycemia, retinopathy [4, 14] and nephropathy[40, 56] are independently associated with decre-ments in psychomotor efﬁciency. in addition, diabeticretinopathy is associated with poor cognitive per-formance on intelligence, information processing,and attention/concentration ability in adult t1dmpatients [57]. however, it is still inconclusive whethermicroangiopathic complications are associated withcognitive impairments in t1dm patients. for exam-ple, the presence of retinopathy is not a signiﬁcantpredictor of poor cognitive performance in adultpatients with t1dm [13]. furthermore, microvas-cular complication status is not a relevant factor forcognitive impairments though adult t1dm patientsperform poorer on general cognitive ability, infor-mation processing speed, and motor speed than thecontrols [58]. on the other hand, macrovascular health is asso- ciated with cognitive impairments in adult t1dmpatients [14]. for instance, a decline in psychomotorspeed can be predicted by macrovascular complica-tions, duration of diabetes, proliferative retinopathy,and autonomic neuropathy [17]. other factors polyneuropathy is shown as the best biomedical predictor of cognitive performance in adult t1dmpatients [59]. high body mass index (bmi) [13, 14]and hypertension [13] are shown as signiﬁcant pre-dictors of poor cognition functions in adult patientswith t1dm. speciﬁcally, systolic blood pressure canbe used to predict the decline in psychomotor speed[17]. on the other hand, neither hypertension nor bmiare implicated in cognitive impairments of t1dm34 w. li et al. / t1dm and cognitive impairments patients [40]. these studies are composed of t1dm patients who vary in age, age at onset of t1dm aswell as disease duration. however, the discrepancyof these ﬁndings warrants further studies to exam-ine hypertension’s and bmi’s roles in the cognitivechanges of t1dm patients. conclusion this review has focused on the cognitive impair- ments in young and adult t1dm patients. thecognitive changes have been examined from the fol-lowing perspectives: aao and duration of t1dm,glycemic dysregulation, dka, and angiopathy. inaddition, other factors such as blood pressure, bmi,and neuropathy are discussed for their relations withthe cognitive changes in t1dm patients. in childrenwith t1dm, impaired cognitive functions or poorcognitive performance were observed in most studies(table 1). in contrast, the impaired cognitive func-tions were seen more consistently in studies withadult t1dm patients (table 2). very few studies havea follow-up long enough to show if the weakened cog-nitive performance and/or functions in childhood willlast into adulthood. however, some evidence [22, 23]has shown early-onset t1dm is associated with brainstructural changes, which might have long-lastingeffects on cognitive functions. however, prospectivestudies with a long follow-up design will be use-ful for clarifying the long-term effects of early-onsett1dm on cognitive functions. in addition, futurestudies are needed to elucidate the underlying mech-anism of t1dm-related cognitive impairments ordementia. disclosure statement authors’ disclosures are available online (http://j- alz.com/manuscript-disclosures/16-1250r1). references [1]

abstract aims/hypothesis. mild cognitive dysfunction is not un- common in adults with type 1 diabetes, but its patho-genesis remains unclear. previous cross-sectional studieshad suggested that microangiopathy might affect brainintegrity and lead to ‘central neuropathy.’ to assess therelationship between changes in cognitive performanceand the incidence of new micro- and macrovascularcomplications, 103 young and middle-aged adults(mean age: 40 yrs) with childhood-onset type 1 diabeteswere followed over a 7-year period, and were comparedto 57 demographically-similar adults without diabetes.methods. all subjects completed a comprehensive battery of neurocognitive tests on two occasions. dia-betic subjects also received repeated medical assess-ments to diagnose the onset of clinically significantcomplications.results. relative to control subjects, diabetic adults showed significant declines on measures of psycho-motor efficiency; no between-group differences wereevident on learning, memory, or problem-solving tasks. the development of proliferative retinopathyand autonomic neuropathy during the follow-up peri-od predicted decline in psychomotor speed ( p<0.01), as did incident macrovascular complications ( p<0.05), systolic blood pressure at follow-up ( p<0.01), and duration of diabetes ( p<0.01). conclusion/interpretation. this study shows that cog- nitive efficiency may decline over time in diabeticadults, and that this neurocognitive change may belinked, at least in part, to the occurrence of complica-tions like proliferative retinopathy and elevated bloodpressure. therapeutic interventions that reduce therisk of vascular complications may have a similarlybeneficial effect on the brain and reduce the risk ofneurocognitive dysfunction in diabetic patients.

clinic, university of pittsburgh school of medicine, pittsburgh, usa 2 department of epidemiology, university of pittsburgh graduate school of public health, usa diabetes mellitus is associated with a greatly in- creased risk of mild brain dysfunction [1]. adults withtype 1 diabetes may manifest impairments on neuro-cognitive tests requiring rapid decision-making andadaptive problem-solving skills [2], learning andmemory [3], visuospatial analysis [4], and psychomo-tor efficiency [5]. compared to their non-diabeticpeers, they may also have increased rates of corticalatrophy [6] and more subcortical and brainstem le-sions [7] on magnetic resonance imaging (mri) scans,slower neural transmission times on brainstem audito-ry evoked potential (baep) studies [7] and more re-gional cerebral blood flow (rcbf) perfusion abnor-malities [8].the aetiology of this brain dysfunction remains controversial. some writers have attributed these ab-normalities to recurrent episodes of moderately severehypoglycaemia [9, 10], but large-scale clinical trialshave not found linkages between neurocognitive im-pairment and hypoglycaemia in adults [11, 12, 13].positron emission tomography [14] and neurophysio-logical event-related potential (p300) studies [15]have also failed to show more brain dysfunction in diabetic patients who have had repeated and/or severeepisodes of hypoglycaemia. on the other hand, in-creasing evidence suggests that chronic hyperglycae-mia may induce a “central neuropathy” that is charac-terized by mental slowing and by longer baep laten-cies, and is associated with poor metabolic control [5,7]. our earlier work examined this issue in a cohort ofmiddle-aged adults who developed diabetes before 18years of age and had this disease for more than 26years, on average. not only were our diabetic subjectsimpaired on tasks requiring psychomotor speed orspatial information processing, but individuals withone or more biomedical complication showed morecognitive impairment than those without complica-tions. of the biomedical variables examined, clinicallysignificant distal symmetrical polyneuropathy (dsp)and/or elevated glycosylated haemoglobin valueswere most strongly associated with psychomotorslowing [5, 16]. if poor metabolic control leads to both biomedical and neurocognitive complications, one would predictthat over time, diabetic adults would show increasing-ly greater cognitive impairment which would be asso-ciated with the occurrence of more, and/or more severe hyperglycaemia-associated complications. wethus conducted the following study to answer threebroad questions. do diabetic adults show a progres-sive decline in cognitive functioning over time? dothese changes occur in all cognitive domains, or aresome cognitive abilities more likely to decline thanothers? if cognitive deterioration occurs, is it relatedto the occurrence of new diabetes-associated biomedi-cal complications? to address those issues, we re-evaluated the neuropsychological and medical statusof diabetic patients and non-diabetic subjects firstseen by us approximately 7 years earlier, comparedtheir current performance to their initial assessmentresults, and evaluated the relationship between cogni-tive change and the incidence of clinically significantcomplications. subjects and methods participants. diabetic patients were originally selected ran- domly from the pittsburgh epidemiology of diabetes compli-cations (edc) study population [17]. edc subjects weredrawn from the children’s hospital of pittsburgh iddm reg-istry which is a childhood onset (<17 year) cohort of type 1diabetic individuals diagnosed or seen within 1 year of diagno-sis at children’s hospital of pittsburgh between 1950 and 1980. non-diabetic participants were recruited by asking eachdiabetic patient to name a spouse, sibling, significant other, orclose friend. in our original study, a total of 181 diabetic adultsand 146 non-diabetic adults were evaluated, all of whom werebetween the ages of 18 and 55 years (mean =33.9±6.5 yrs). atfollow-up, 34 diabetic patients could not be located or hadmoved out of state. an additional eight diabetic subjects haddied, six were too ill to be tested, two were diagnosed with ma-jor current psychiatric disorders, and 28 declined to participate,leaving 103. of the original 146 control subjects, 44 declinedto participate and 45 could not be located or had moved out ofstate, leaving 57. within each group, those who participatedand those who refused or were lost to follow-up did not differon measures of age, education, depressive symptomatology orfull scale iq—with one exception. control subjects who werelost to follow-up or relocated were younger than those whoparticipated (32.1±7.1 vs 34.9±7.0; p<0.05). also noteworthy is the fact that a relatively large proportion of diabetic subjectswho had dsp at baseline did not participate in the follow-upevaluation. although 41% of the entire original diabetic cohortmet criteria for dsp, nearly half were not assessed by us at fol-low-up, because they were deceased ( n=7), too ill ( n=6), had moved away or were lost to follow-up ( n=10), or declined (n=13). this study focuses on 103 diabetic patients and 57 non-dia- betic adults who were evaluated twice. none had a current orpast history of chronic alcohol or drug abuse, a head injurywith a loss of consciousness that exceeded 30 min, or a currentpsychiatric disorder. both the original and follow-up protocolshad been reviewed and approved by the university of pitts-burgh institutional review board, and written informed con-sent was obtained from subjects, all of whom were paid fortheir participation. medical variables. diabetic subjects were examined biennially by edc staff and received a detailed medical examinationfrom a trained internist with appropriate laboratory tests to as-sess the presence of micro- and macrovascular complicationsand co-morbid disorders. this methodology is described else-where [18]. non-diabetic comparison subjects completed asimilar but abbreviated medical examination at the edc re-search centre to ensure that none met criteria for diabetes [19]. stable glycosylated haemoglobin (hba 1) was measured with automatic high performance liquid chromatography (dia-mat, biorad, hercules, calif., usa); the normal range is 4.9to 7.3%. blood pressure was measured with a random zerosphygmomanometer according to the hypertension detectionand follow-up program protocol, after a 5 min rest [20]; themean of the second and third readings was used. vibratorythresholds were measured on the plantar surface of the greattoe on the dominant side of the body, using the vibratron ii de-vice (physitemp instruments, clifton, n.j., usa). a forced-choice procedure with up to 20 trials was used to assess largesensory nerve fibres [21]. visual acuity was assessed at a dis-tance of 4 metres from the eye charts, with different chartsused for the two eyes, according to procedures adopted by thedcct [22]. retinopathy was assessed in diabetic subjects with stereo- scopic color fundus photographs in three standardized fields.photographs were graded at the wisconsin reading centre us-ing the wisconsin epidemiologic study of diabetic retinopa-thy classification and grading system [23]. proliferative dia-betic retinopathy (pdr) was defined as grade 60 or higher inone eye or a grade less than 60 but with panretinal photocoag-ulation scars consistent with laser therapy. overt nephropathy(on) was defined as an albumin excretion rate greater thanc. m.

least two of three timed urine samples, or end-stage renal disease (renal dialysis or transplant). distalsymmetric polyneuropathy (dsp) was based on a clinical neu-rological evaluation carried out by a trained internist and de-fined according to the dcct criteria [24] as the presence oftwo or more of the following: symptoms consistent with dsp,decreased or absent tendon reflexes, or signs of sensory loss,all in the absence of other known etiologies. autonomic neu-ropathy (an) was determined from the mean value of thelongest rr interval during expiration and the shortest rr in-terval during inspiration based on a continuous ecg recordingduring a 1 min breathing procedure. an was considered to be present if the e/i ratio was less than or equal to 1.1 [25]. peripheral vascular disease (pvd) was defined as an ankle-to-arm blood pressure ratio less than 0.9 in any one of the fourdistal leg arteries (tibial anterior or dorsalis pedis), or by am-putation for vascular insufficiency. coronary artery disease(cad) was defined as angina diagnosed by a clinic physician;myocardial infarction confirmed by q-waves on electrocardio-gram and/or validated hospital records, or coronary artery ste-nosis greater than or equal to 50% confirmed by angiography. neuropsychological assessment. detailed descriptions of each measure can be found elsewhere [26, 27]. learning and memo-ry skills were assessed with the verbal paired-associate learn-ing test, the symbol-digit paired-associate learning test, thefour-word short-term memory test, and the rey complexfigure memory test. problem-solving and spatial organizationwas assessed with the tactual performance test, the objectassembly and block design subtests from the wechsler adultintelligence scale, revised (wais-r), and the wisconsin cardsorting test. psychomotor efficiency was measured with thecompletion time score from the digit vigilance test, thewais-r digit symbol substitution test, the grooved peg-board, and part b of the trail making test. intelligence wasassessed at baseline with the wais-r. symptoms of depres-sion over the previous month were ascertained from the symp-tom-checklist 90-r (scl-90) [28]. acute emotional state atthe time of testing was evaluated with the profile of moodstates [29]. to ensure that neuropsychological test results werenot influenced by ambient hypoglycaemia, a fingerstick bloodglucose reading was obtained before cognitive assessment;subjects with values less than 3.9 mmol/l were treated with asnack and re-tested.statistical analyses. descriptive univariate between-group comparisons were assessed with student’s ttest, analysis of variance (anov a) with planned comparisons, chi square, orwilcoxon, as appropriate. a pvalue less than or equal to 0.05 was considered to be statistically significant. factor analysistechniques (principal components analysis with varimax rota-tion) were used to cluster the large number of neuropsycholog-ical variables into a manageable number of broad cognitive do-mains. for each test, raw scores were converted into standard-ized z scores (m=0; sd=1), using the mean and standard devi-ation values from the non-diabetic comparison group at time 1.domain z scores were calculated as the mean z value of thecognitive tests assigned to that specific domain. a two-factor(group ×time) repeated measures anov a procedure was used to evaluate change in functioning over time within each do-main. if statistically significant group ×time interactions were found, logistic regression techniques were used with diabeticsubjects to identify salient predictors of significant cognitivedeterioration. all statistical analyses were carried out usingspss software (version 11 for windows; spss, chicago, ill.,usa). results demographic and biomedical characteristics of the two groups are summarized in table 1. both groups wereof average intelligence, moderately well-educated, andwithout symptoms of depression. as expected, the dia-betic group showed elevated glycosylated haemoglo-bin values, systolic blood pressures, and great toe vibratory thresholds. biomedical complications. at time 1, this group of di- abetic patients had high rates of microvascular com-plications (an: 23% of sample; dsp: 27%; on: 29%;pdr: 44%), but relatively low rates of macrovascularcomplications (cad: 9%; pvd: 5%). over the ensu-ing 7 year follow-up period, incidence of new micro-vascular complications increased appreciably (an:30%; dsp: 22%; on: 9%; pdr: 16%). the incidencetable 1. demographic and biomedical

of the samplewere without any complication. cognitive performance and complications. principal components factor analysis assigned the test scores tothree cognitive domains: learning and memory, spa-tial and problem-solving skills, and psychomotor effi-ciency. together, these accounted for 63% of the totalvariance. results from the anov as showed that statistically significant deterioration was evident onlyon the psychomotor efficiency measures. there was amain effect of group (f=12.77; p=0.0001), as well as a main effect of time (f=5.66; p=0.019) and a group x time interaction (f=8.01; p=0.005). that is, diabet- ic subjects were consistently slower than control sub-jects at both assessments, and showed a greater degreeof decline in functioning from time 1 to time 2, ascompared to control subjects (fig. 1). in contrast, bothgroups performed nearly identically on measures oflearning and memory (all f s<1; p s>0.75) and on mea- sures of spatial and problem-solving skills (all f s≤1). hierarchical logistic regression techniques were used with the diabetic sample group to evaluate thepredictors of psychomotor deterioration (dichotomizedas a decline in summary psychomotor z score ≥0.5 sd unit). using that operational definition, 39% of the diabetic group sample and 9% of the non-diabeticgroup sample met criteria for psychomotor decline(p<0.0001). psychomotor change was

p>0.10). the use of a hierarchical regression procedure al- lows us to systematically examine the independentcontribution of each block of variables, after takinginto account the effects of the previous block of vari-ables. this analysis examines the effects of threetypes of predictor variables on change in psychomotorspeed over a 7 year period: time 1 variables (e.g.,baseline psychomotor score; prevalence of micro- andmacrovascular complications), time 2 variables (e.g.,incidence of new micro- and macrovascular complica-tions), and other diabetes-associated variables (e.g.,elevated blood pressure, duration of disease, recentmetabolic control). predictor variables were entered inc. m. ryan et al.: cognitive efficiency declines over time in adults with type 1 diabetes 943 eight separate blocks: (i) time 1 psychomotor summa-ry score; (ii) time 1 prevalence of microvascular com-plications (an, dsp, nephropathy, retinopathy); (iii)time 1 prevalence of macrovascular complications(cad, pvd); (iv) time 2 incidence of microvascularcomplications; (v) time 2 incidence of macrovascularcomplications; (vi) time 2 systolic blood pressure;(vii) duration of diabetes; (viii) time 2 metabolic con-trol (hba 1). systolic blood pressure was included in these analyses because prior studies have shown thatelevated blood pressure can affect neuropsychologicaltest performance in adults with diabetes. our analyses showed that pre-existing microvascu- lar complications at time 1 predicted slowing (block 2:χ 2=9.2; p=0.057; nagelkerke r2change =0.12), but pre-existing macrovascular complications did not(block 3: χ 2<1). both incident microvascular compli- cations at time 2 (block 4: χ2=14.2; p=0.007; r2 change =0.17) and incident macrovascular complica- tions (block 5: χ2=6.4; p=0.04; r2change =0.07) were predictors of psychomotor slowing at time 2, as weresystolic blood pressure at time 2 (block 7: χ 2=9.7; p=0.002; r2 change =0.09) and duration of diabetes (block 7: χ2=9.1; p=0.003; r2 change =0.08). the ad- dition of hba1at time 2 did not contribute ( χ2<1) and was deleted from the final model. coefficients for the final logistic regression model are summarized intable 2. this model, which included seven blocks ofvariables, correctly classified 83% of subjects and explained 53% of the variance . when the analysis wasrepeated, but with the substitution of total number ofmicro- and macrovascular complications for the pres-ence or absence of specific complications, a similarpattern of results was obtained (full model not shown).both

incident ( χ2=6.4; p=0.01; r2change=0.08) microvascular complications were associated with psychomotor slowing, as was the num-ber of incident macrovascular complications ( χ 2=4.3; p=0.04; r2change =0.05). to assess the magnitude of psychomotor slowing associated with the occurrence of biomedical compli-cations over time, a subsequent analysis compared in-dividuals with no complication at both time points, tothose with at least one complication already presentby the time 1 assessment, and to those who first werediagnosed with the complication between time 1 andtime 2. individuals who developed retinopathy be-tween time 1 and time 2 showed greater psychomotordeterioration than those with no retinopathy at eitherassessment ( p<0.02), but earned scores that were com- parable to individuals with pre-existing retinopathy attime 1 (table 3). these data show that a diagnosis ofpdr is associated with about a third of a standard de-viation unit decline in psychomotor efficiency. a sim-ilar pattern of results is seen when one examines therelationship between onset of autonomic neuropathyand changes in psychomotor function. in contrast, theincidence of either dsp or on by time 2 does not pre-dict slowing at time 2 ( p>0.05), but the presence of either of those complications at time 1 does ( p<0.05). given the well-established relationship between glycosylated haemoglobin values and biomedicalcomplications, the failure of our multivariate analyses to show any association between current hba 1and cognitive change was unexpected. to evaluate thepossibility that subjects with a recent onset of compli-cations had altered their diabetes management or otherwise improved their metabolic control, we con-ducted a series of exploratory univariate analyses thatcompared hba 1values at baseline and follow-up for subjects with and without new complications. thestrong relationship between retinopathy and cognitivedysfunction in this study led us to focus on the devel-opment of pdr. we compared the three subgroups, asdescribed above: (i) no pdr at either assessment; (ii)pdr present at both assessments; (iii) incident pdr—developing after the first assessment. glycosylatedhaemoglobin values at baseline (assessment 1) werehigher for subjects who subsequently developed pdrby assessment 2 (11.6±1.9%), as compared to thosewith no pdr at either assessment (9.9±1.4; t=2.9;p<0.007) and those with pdr at the time of study entry (10.7±1.8; t=1.77; p=0.08). measures of hba 1 obtained at follow-up indicated that individuals with an incidence of pdr between the first and second assessment showed a decline in hba 1values (from 11.6±1.9% to 10.1±1.3%; t=2.42; p=0.03); the other two groups showed no change over time.table 2. summary of coefficients from

leads us to conclude thatthe development of clinically significant biomedicalcomplications correlates with, and could contribute to,the psychomotor slowing which is characteristicallyseen in this patient population. we and others havepreviously shown that mental and motor slowing is anearly ubiquitous sequela of both type 1 and type 2diabetes [2, 3, 5, 30, 31]. this prospective assessmentconfirms those earlier cross-sectional findings byshowing that over time, 39% of our diabetic sampleshowed a marked (more than 0.5 sd units) decline on a composite measure of psychomotor efficiency,whereas only 9% of our non-diabetic comparisongroup showed a similar decline. it is noteworthy thatcognitive change in this patient cohort was limited to the psychomotor domain. neither learning andmemory skills, nor visuospatial and problem-solvingskills, were found to deteriorate. our data also provide evidence that the occurrence of new diabetes-associated biomedical complicationswas associated with deterioration in psychomotor efficiency. within our sample, the incidence of two microvascular complications had the greatest effecton psychomotor decline: proliferative diabetic reti-nopathy, and autonomic neuropathy. the magnitudeof this effect was large, with each incident complica-tion being associated with a decline of more than ahalf standard deviation, on average. additional sa-lient predictors of decline included longer duration ofdiabetes, and elevated blood pressure. together, thesevariables accounted for 40% of the variance. in con-trast, glycosylated haemoglobin values measured attime 2 did not contribute further to the explanatoryvalue of this model. our failure to find an isomorphicrelationship between hba 1levels and cognitive de- cline may reflect the possibility—as supported in ourexploratory analyses—that the development of a clin-ically significant complication like retinopathy couldbe accompanied by improvements in metabolic con-trol that might be secondary to changes in diabetesmanagement. a substantial body of literature has suggested that chronic hyperglycaemia and/or the occurrence ofcomplications could directly or indirectly affect brainfunction [32, 33]. as virtually all of this work hasbeen conducted in adults with type 2 diabetes, it isunlikely that those cognitive changes can be attributedto recurrent hypoglycaemia, given the very low ratesof hypoglycaemia in patients with type 2 diabetes[34]. in longitudinal studies, performance decrementsover a 3- to 7-year follow-up period have been foundmost consistently on psychomotor tasks like the digitsymbol substitution test (dsst), and these effectspersist, even after controlling statistically for othercardiovascular risk factors [35, 36, 37, 38].aside from our own work, only two studies have followed type 1 diabetic patients over time. unfortu-nately, because the focus of both the dcct and thestockholm diabetes intervention study was on thecognitive effects of hypoglycaemia, analyses did notdirectly examine the possibility that duration of diabe-tes, presence of complications, or other markers ofpoor metabolic control might adversely affect cogni-tion. as neither included a group of demographically-similar non-diabetic subjects, analyses could not takeinto account the potentially confounding effects ofnormal age-related changes in cognitive performanceor of practice. nevertheless, comparisons between in-tensively and conventionally treated participants in thedcct indicated that over a 6-year follow-up period,those treated conventionally with one or two daily in-jections showed statistically significant (albeit slight)worsening over time on measures of motor speed, andthis was directly associated with higher glycosylatedhaemoglobin values—and by implication, with more,or more severe, microvascular complications [12]. previous cross-sectional research has identified two microvascular complications—retinopathy and periph-eral neuropathy—as predictors of cognitive dysfunc-tion in adults with diabetes [5, 39]. for example, a recent study of young adults with type 1 diabetes ofrelatively short duration showed that background dia-betic retinopathy was associated with poorer perfor-mance on measures of fluid intelligence, informationprocessing efficiency, and attention, and was also as-sociated with higher rates of brain structure abnormal-ities (white matter hyperintensities) on mri scans[39]. others have reported the existence of a similarrelationship between retinopathy and cognitive dys-function, but in the absence of diabetes. a study ofmore than 8500 middle-aged adults without stroke,found retinal microaneurysms and/or haemorrhages tobe associated with lower scores on measures of mentalefficiency (e.g., dsst) and delayed memory, even after controlling for education, diabetes, blood pres-sure, carotid intima-media thickness and other poten-tial risk factors [40]. arguing that examination of theretinal arterioles provides a non-invasive assessmentof the cerebral microcirculation, those authors con-cluded that retinopathy-associated cognitive impair-ment could have a vascular component, and speculat-ed that this could reflect a disruption of the blood-brain barrier [40] and/or the development of whitematter lesions [41]. distal symmetric polyneuropathy has also been found to predict the degree of cognitive slowing inadults with type 1 diabetes [5], and like both retinop-athy and nephropathy, this neurological complicationis now thought to be largely vascular in origin [42]. ifthe effects of these microvascular complications onthe central nervous system (cns) are additive or syn-ergistic, one might expect to see a relationship be-tween the number of complications and the magnitude c. m. ryan et al.: cognitive efficiency declines over time in adults with type 1 diabetes 945of cognitive change. results from our study are con- sistent with that possibility: the greater the number of incident complications, the greater the magnitudeof psychomotor slowing. although it is tempting to attribute diabetes-associated cognitive dysfunctionlargely to the accretion of microvascular changes inthe cns, other plausible underlying mechanisms in-clude alterations in aminergic neurotransmitter path-ways [43], and/or the accumulation of advanced gly-cosylation end products in the cns [44]. elevated blood pressure is a common comorbid condition in patients with diabetes, which was alsofound by us to be an independent predictor of cogni-tive decline. multiple studies have shown that elevat-ed blood pressure not only predicts later-life changeson measures of brain morphology [45, 46] and cogni-tive function [45, 47]—particularly on speeded testslike the dsst [37, 48], but could act synergisticallywith diabetes [49] or insulin resistance [50] to in-crease the severity of neurocognitive impairment.higher blood pressure might adversely affect mentalefficiency via vascular and/or neural pathways. forexample, during the performance of increasingly diffi-cult cognitive tasks, hypertensive adults show a rela-tively smaller increase in rcbf, as compared to nor-motensives [51]. since cognitive effort normally trig-gers an increase in cerebral blood supply in responseto increasing metabolic demands, any reduction invascular reactivity is likely to induce a decline inmental efficiency. the greatly increased incidence ofwhite matter lesions in adults with hypertension [52,53] could also underlie the decline in mental efficien-cy, since the presence of white matter lesions is asso-ciated with slower performance on psychomotor taskslike the dsst [54, 55]. whether those declines reflectneural changes secondary to demyelination [56] or tothe haemodynamic abnormalities associated withwhite matter lesions [57] remains to be determined. in our earlier cross-sectional work, we speculated that diabetes-associated mental slowing is a conse-quence of a “central neuropathy” which is character-ized by diffusely-distributed cerebral white matterdysfunction and is associated with hyperglycaemia-induced complications [5]. results from the currentstudy are consistent with that hypothesis. we foundthat the incidence of complications—particularly reti-nopathy, predicted poorer performance on measures ofpsychomotor efficiency that are known to be adverse-ly affected by cerebral white matter diseases like mul-tiple sclerosis, binswanger’s disease, and alcoholism[58]. although we did not use either neurophysiologi-cal or neuroimaging techniques to assess cns integri-ty, others have reported relationships between diabe-tes-related biomedical complications and both slowerbaep conduction velocities [59, 60] and increased in-cidence of white matter hyperintensities on mri [39].a more definitive test of the white matter hypothesiswill require the pairing of traditional neuropsychologi-cal and electrophysiological measures of cns func- tion with newer imaging modalities, like diffusion ten-sor imaging [61], to map the integrity of white mattertracts in diabetic adults. in conclusion, our data shows that in young and middle-aged adults with type 1 diabetes, cognitivefunction declines over time and these changes arelinked to the development of microvascular complica-tions and to elevations in blood pressure. if, as ourfindings suggest, microangiopathy is a leading cause,or marker, of neurocognitive decline, then any thera-peutic intervention that reduces the risk of complica-tions may have a similarly salutary effect on the cns,and induce a corresponding reduction in the risk ofdeveloping neurocognitive complications in diabeticpatients. acknowledgements . this research was supported in part by national institute of health grant 5 ro1 dk39629. references 1. biessels g-j (1999) cerebral

abstract aims/hypothesis in patients with type 1 diabetes, there has been concern about the effects of recurrent hypoglycaemiaand chronic hyperglycaemia on cognitive function. because other biomedical factors may also increase the risk of cognitive decline, this study examined whether macro-vascular risk factors (hypertension, smoking, hypercholes- terolaemia, obesity), sub-clinical macrovascular disease (carotid intima –media thickening, coronary calcification) and microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy)were associated with decrements in cognitive function over an extended time period. methods type 1 diabetes patients ( n=1,144) who had completed a comprehensive cognitive test battery at entry into the diabetes control and complications trial were re- assessed at a mean of 18.5 (range: 15 –23) years later. univariate and multivariable models examined the relation- ship between cognitive change and the presence of micro- and macrovascular complications and risk factors. results univariate modelling showed that smoking history was modestly associated with decrements in learning, memory, spatial information-processing and psychomotor efficiency;hypertension was associated with only psychomotor slowing. multivariable modelling demonstrated that hba 1clevel, and retinal and renal complications were each independentlyassociated with decrements in psychomotor efficiency. in contrast, no macrovascular risk factors were significant after correcting for multiple comparisons. no interactions werefound between these predictors and sex, severe hypoglycaemic events or presence of the apoe ε4a l l e l e . conclusions/interpretation in relatively healthy, middle- aged adults with type 1 diabetes who had been followedfor an average of 18.5 years, long-term metabolic control and microvascular factors are independently associated with a decline in cognitive functio n specifically affecting measures of psychomotor efficiency. trial registration

epidemiology of diabetes interventions and complications imt intima ––media thickening pdr proliferative diabetic retinopathy introduction cognitive dysfunction has been found in multiple studies comparing both adolescents and adults with type 1 diabeteswith non-diabetic individuals. these effects are most apparent on measures of psychomotor efficiency, intelligence, sustained attention, speed of information processing, cogni-tive flexibility and visual perception [ 1]. the pathophysio- logical basis for these findings remains poorly understood. although earlier reports attributed such deficits to the effectsof recurrent, moderately severe hypoglycaemia, a growing body of research has failed to substantiate such linkages [1–4]. this was particularly apparent in our analyses of the long-term follow-up data from 1,144 participants in the diabetes control and complications trial (dcct)/ epidemiology of diabetes interventions and complications(edic) study [ 2]. in those analyses, we found no relation- ship between decline in cognitive functioning over an 18 year follow-up period and the occurrence of one or more episodesof hypoglycaemia-associated seizure or coma. on the other hand, results from the same dcct/edic study [ 2], as well as findings from several recent cross- sectional and longitudinal studies [ 1,3,5–7], identified associations between mild cognitive dysfunction and chronic hyperglycaemia, defined as a long history of poormetabolic control and elevated hba 1cvalues. two well- known outcomes of chronic hyperglycaemia, diabetic retinopathy [ 3,4,6] and distal symmetric polyneuropathy [7,8], have previously been associated with cognitive dysfunction in several small studies of adults with type 1diabetes, leading to speculation that diabetic cognitive complications may be largely microvascular in origin [ 9]. cognitive function can also be influenced by other biomedical factors that are commonly associated with diabetes. macrovascular risk factors like cigarette smoking [10], elevated blood pressure and hypertension [ 11], hyper-cholesterolaemia [ 12], and subclinical atherosclerosis have been reported to impair cognition in non-diabetic adults [13] and in older adults with type 2 diabetes [ 14,15]. despite those observations, no study has comprehensively assessed the degree to which macro- and microvascular complications individually and/or synergistically influencecognitive performance in large numbers of young and middle-aged adults with type 1 diabetes. the dcct and the follow-up edic study provide an excellent means of examining those inter-relationships in a very large sample of carefully monitored adults with type 1 diabetes. participants completed an extensive battery ofcognitive tests, which was repeated over the course of the dcct/edic study period. they underwent frequent and systematic biomedical evaluations to ascertain changes inmetabolic control over time and were also assessed for occurrence of micro- and macrovascular risk factors and clinically significant complications. these data, collected prospectively over a mean of 18.5 years, allowed us to test the hypothesis that the cognitive changes occurring in adults with type 1 diabetesare associated with four broad classes of biomedical variables: (1) macrovascular risk factors (hypertension, smoking, abnormal lipid levels, obesity); (2) development of microvascular complications (retinopathy, nephropathy); (3) evidence of sub-clinical macrovascular disease (carotidintima –media thickening [imt], coronary calcification); and (4) time-weighted hba 1clevels. we examined the relative contribution of these biomedical variables andcarried out additional analyses to determine whether effects of these factors on cognitive performance were influenced by sex, age, history of severe hypoglycaemia or presence oftheapoe ε4 allele. methods participants between 1983 and 1989, 1,441 patients from 13 to 39 years of age were enrolled in the dcct and followed until 1993 [ 16]. at the end of the dcct, 1,375 (96%) of the 1,428 surviving participants volunteered tocontinue in the edic observational follow-up study. in 2004, 85% of the surviving eligible participants ( n=1,144) (fig. 1) were evaluated using the same cognitive test battery as that used at baseline in the dcct. this group constitutes the sample reported on here [ 2]. dcct participants who did not participate in this follow-up studywere comparable to the 1,144 participants in terms of baseline demographic, biomedical and cognitive measures. this research protocol was approved by each site ’s institutional research ethics committee; each participant gave written informed consent prior to the initiation of research activities.246 diabetologia (2011) 54:245 –255cognitive assessment cognitive testing was conducted at each site by personnel trained and certified by the dcct/ edic central neurobehavioral coding unit [ 17]. the test protocol, which took 4 to 5 h to complete, included the following widely used, well- validated tests that were administered initially during the dcct: six subtests(similarities, comprehension, digit span, digit symbol, block design and object assembly) from the wechsler adult intelligence scale [ 18]; four subtests (category test, tactual performance test, trail making test and finger tapping test) from the halstead –reitan neuropsychological battery [ 19]; the logical memory and visual reproductions subtests fromthe wechsler memory scale [ 20]; the digit vigilance test [21]; the grooved pegboard test [ 22]; the verbal fluency (fas) test [ 23]; the four-word short term memory test [24]; the symbol-digit learning test [ 25]; and the embedded figures test [ 25]. tests were administered in a fixed sequence and capillary blood glucose levels wereroutinely monitored to verify absence of hypoglycaemia during testing [ 2]. during the dcct, 24 test variables were chosen a priori to be of particular diagnostic value when applied to patients with type 1 diabetes. a standardised ( z)s c o r ew a s calculated for each variable, with the mean and standard deviation from the baseline assessment of the dcct cohort used as reference. these procedures have been outlinedelsewhere [ 17]. to reduce the number of comparisons, the 24 standardised scores were grouped into one of eight cognitive domains consistent with standard neuropsycho-logical assessment strategies [ 26]. for each domain, the simple average of the standardised scores was used to represent the change from baseline.biomedical evaluations during edic, participants had an annual history update, physical examination, electro- cardiogram and laboratory testing, using the same methodsemployed during the dcct [ 16]. participants self-reported the presence of sensory symptoms of peripheral neuropathy [27]; best-corrected visual acuity was measured at 4-year intervals during edic. the visual acuity examination closest to the cognitive re-evaluation was used in these analyses. participants were asked quarterly in the dcctand annually in edic to provide information about smoking and alcohol consumption. hba 1cvalues were measured in a central laboratory by high-performance liquid chromatography [ 28], with tests done quarterly during dcct and annually during edic. time-weighted values across the entire duration of thedcct/edic study were used in our analyses. they were calculated from dcct inception by weighting each dcct value by one quarter of a year and weighting each edicvalue by 1 year. severe hypoglycaemia was defined as any event leading to seizure or coma [ 2,29]. fasting lipid profiles and 4 h urine collections for measurement ofalbumin excretion rate and creatinine clearance were obtained in alternate years during edic. renal complica- tions were defined as a centrally measured serum creatinine level of at least 177 μmol/l, or treatment with dialysis or transplantation for chronic renal failure [ 27]. hypertension was defined as systolic blood pressure ≥140 mmhg or diastolic blood pressure ≥90 mmhg or documented hypertension or the use of anti-hypertensive agents for thetreatment of hypertension. hypercholesterolaemia was defined as ldl-cholesterol ≥3.4 mmol/l or the use of lipid-lowering agents. retinopathy was assessed by seven-field stereoscopic fundus photography according to the dcct/edic protocol [ 30]. for these analyses, retinopathy was defined by the presence of proliferative diabeticretinopathy (pdr) and/or history of panretinal scatter- photocoagulation (laser) therapy. the measurement of intima –media thickness was per- formed during years 1, 6 and 12 of edic; for these analyses, the year 12 examination results were used. a single longitudinal lateral view of the distal 10 mm of theright and left common carotid arteries was obtained using b-mode ultrasonography [ 31]. coronary artery calcification was measured with computed tomography on one occasionduring years 7 and 9 of edic and scans were read centrally [32]. genotyping of the apoe haplotype, rs7412 ( ε2/ε3) and rs429358 ( ε3/ε4), and of the ace intron 16 indel (rs4340) was performed as described previously [ 33]. statistical analyses separate analysis of covariance models were used to assess the relationship between each of the eight cognitive domain scores

presence of painful neuropathy and visual acuity at edic year 12. additionally, five multivariable models were evaluated usingpsychomotor efficiency as the dependent variable to assess the independent effects of multiple complications and risk factors. statistical analyses were performed using sasversion 8.2 statistical analysis software (cary, nc, usa). univariate comparisons are indicated as being significant at p<0.006 after bonferroni correction. for the final model, where all previously significant variables were entered, the hochberg correction ( p<0.05) was used to control for the false discovery rate [ 34]. results demographic and clinical characteristics of sample when restudied an average of 18.5 years after their dcctbaseline assessment, participants ranged in age from 29 to 62 years (mean 45.7, sd 6.8) and were in relatively good health despite an average duration of 25 years of diabetes(table 1). as reported previously, participants treated with intensive or conventional therapy during the dcct had indistinguishable hba 1clevels during follow-up in edic, with values declining from 9.0±1.6% (mean ± sd) at dcct baseline to 7.7±1.2% in the former conventionaltreatment group and to 7.8±1.2% in the former intensive treatment group. there were no statistically significant ( p< 0.01) differences between the two treatment groups for anyof the demographic characteristics at dcct baseline and edic year 12. association of micro- and macrovascular risk factors and complications with change in cognitive function after adjusting for sex, baseline age, baseline education, presenceof painful neuropathy and visual acuity at edic year 12, length of follow-up and the number of interval cognitive tests taken, modest associations were found between complicationsand cognitive performance (tables 2and 3). the most consistent associations appeared in the domains of psycho- motor efficiency (renal complication, pdr) and motor speed(pdr). macrovascular risk factors were also found to be associated with cognitive outcomes, including hypertension (with psychomotor efficiency) and smoking (with learning,immediate memory delayed re call, spatial information processing and psychomotor efficiency). hba 1cwas also associated with psychomotor efficiency and motor speed. multivariable modelling of cognitive decline to evaluate the independent effects of multiple complication and riskfactor predictor variables, we selected psychomotor efficien- cy as the dependent variable because it has been identified in other studies as the cognitive domain most often affected inpatients with diabetes [ 1,3,4,35] and, as expected, showed the strongest associations with vascular complications and risk factors in this study (table 4). the domain included five test scores: verbal fluency (total correct); digit symbol (total correct in 90 seconds); trail making part b (total time); and grooved pegboard (completion time for domi-nant and non-dominant hands). five multivariate models were evaluated: (1) base model using the demographic covariates evaluated in the separate analysis of covariancemodels; (2) addition of macrovascular risk factors and hba 1cto the base model; (3) addition of macrovascular disease to the base model; (4) addition of microvasculartable 1 demographic characteristics at dcct baseline and edic year 12

previously significant variables in a single model. based on the fifth (final) model described above (table 4), five variables predicted decline in psychomotor efficiency over the 18.5 year follow-up period: two demographicvariables (age, education), two microvascular complications (renal complication, pdr) and hba 1c. one additional variable (common carotid imt) was significant at p<0.01, but was marginally beyond the established level of hochberg- corrected statistical significance (hochberg-corrected p= 0.08). taken together, these variables explained 23% of thevariance in change in psychomotor speed. somewhat surprisingly, other well-known candidate variables (e.g. hypertension, hypercholesterolaemia, smoking) were unrelat-ed to cognitive outcomes in these multivariable models. we also found no interactions between any of the predictors and sex, age (older vs younger), number of severe hypoglycaemicevents or presence of the apoe ε4a l l e l e( d a t an o ts h o w n ) . the correlation matrix between all possible covariates was examined to assess for potential multicollinearity. interactionswere fit in the final model for correlations exceeding 0.40 and none were found to be statistically significant.discussion this study indicates that over an 18 year period, the development of clinically significant microvascular compli- cations is associated with modest declines in cognitivefunctioning in relatively healthy young and middle-aged adults with type 1 diabetes. multivariable modelling demon- strated that the level of glycaemic control, indexed by hba 1c level, the occurrence of serious diabetic retinopathy (defined as presence of pdr and/or history of panretinal laser therapy) and renal complications were each independentlyassociated with declining performance in measures of psychomotor efficiency. these relationships persisted even after controlling for demographic characteristics (age,education) and health factors (symptomatic peripheral neuropathy, reduced visual acuity) known to influence cognitive performance. in contrast, test scores were unrelatedto recurrent episodes of severe hypoglycaemia, presence of theapoe ε4 allele or

reported that level of depression measured using the scl-90 was associated withcognitive function [ 2], but found that it did not interact with biomedical predictors in that set of analyses. several earlier, smaller studies reported associations between retinopathy and psychomotor efficiency in adults with [ 4,6] and without diabetes [ 36]. our study is the first to show that the presence of another common microvascu-lar complication, significant kidney dysfunction, also independently predicts cognitive decline in adults with type 1 diabetes. the relationship between cognitive decline andclinically significant microvascular complications suggests that a ‘microvascular ’pathway may contribute to cerebral dysfunction by reducing the efficient delivery of substrateto neurons as a consequence of microangiopathy [ 5]. studies of non-diabetic adults [ 36] have shown that the presence of retinal microvascular abnormalities is associatedwith the same pattern of psychomotor slowing as seen in our cohort and is also associated with evidence of cerebral atrophy detected by magnetic resonance imaging [ 37] and subclinical cerebral infarcts [ 38]. given the close anatom- ical and physiological relationships between retinal and cerebral vascular networks [ 39], it now appears that retinal microvascular disease may be a marker of damage to cerebral microcirculation [ 40,41]. our work also suggests that diabetic renal disease is a marker of brain dysfunction. the underlying mechanism remains poorly understood, but may reflect the magnitude of microvascular complicationsin multiple organ systems. in addition to detecting relationships between microvascu- lar complications and cognitive outcomes, our study alsofound an independent association between change in cogni- tion and time-weighted hba 1cvalues. this apparent ‘non- vascular ’relationship may reflect the deleterious effects of high brain glucose levels on neuronal integrity. recent research using proton magnetic resonance spectroscopy has detected elevated levels of brain glucose and glutamate (anexcitatory neurotransmitter that can cause neuronal damage in high concentrations) within prefrontal regions in a large sample of young adults with childhood onset of type 1diabetes compared with non-diabetic control participants [42]. among patients with type 1 diabetes, higher hba 1c values were associated with elevated prefrontal glutamate concentration. elevated glutamate was, in turn, negatively correlated with performance in measures of psychomotor speed. duration of poorer metabolic control is also inverselycorrelated with levels of n-acetylaspartate and choline- containing compounds in white matter and in deep grey matter [ 43]. these and other [ 44] brain magnetic resonance spectroscopy findings suggest that axonal injury, demyelin- ation and increased membrane proliferation secondary to gliosis have occurred and may be a consequence of glucoseneurotoxicity [ 45]. this non-vascular pathway could explain, at least in part, the recent observation that adults with a long history of type 1 diabetes manifest psychomotor slowingassociated with microstructural damage to white matter fibre tracts in the corpus callosum and corona radiata [ 46]. the magnitude of cognitive decline reported in this study is modest, but comparable in size and scope to that reported in other studies of adults with type 1 diabetes [ 1]. it now appears that tests of mental and motor slowing,particularly those requiring ‘psychomotor integration ’or eye–hand coordination, are especially sensitive to the effects of chronic hyperglycaemia and are associated withseverity of retinal microangiopathy [ 4,6]. the neuro- imaging literature suggests that optimal performance of these types of cognitive tasks requires the integrity ofmultiple small and distinct anatomical substrates in the left and right hemispheres, compared with other types of cognitive tasks, which may activate more limited neuro-anatomic areas [ 47]. thus, if chronic hyperglycaemia leads to significant hypoperfusion in multiple brain regions and also disrupts the integrity of associative axonal networks,one might expect to see greater decline in psychomotor speed than with changes in other cognitive domains. this prediction is consistent with our data, as well as with the cognitive literature on type 1 diabetes [ 1]. in many ways it is not surprising that, as a group, our participants showed minimal cognitive dysfunction. all are relatively healthy young and middle-aged adults who developed diabetes in adolescence or early adulthood(mean age at diagnosis 21 years) and whose diabetes has been carefully managed and monitored. to date, two other studies have measured cognitive function in patients withtype 1 diabetes over an extended period of time [ 6,44]. only one of those studies explicitly examined the relation- ship between changes in cognitive function and thedevelopment of vascular complications [ 6]. in that study, the authors reported stronger relationships between cogni- tive change and vascular complications in their relativelysmall ( n=103) study sample, but their participants differed from the dcct/edic cohort in several potentially impor- tant ways, including longer duration of diabetes and poorermetabolic control. very few cognitive studies have been conducted on older adults with type 1 diabetes [ 3], but extensive research on older adults with type 2 diabetes clearly demonstrates that in those over the age of 65, the presence of diabetes accelerates the rate of cognitive decline. relative to theirnon-diabetic peers, individuals with type 2 diabetes showed 1.2- to 1.5-fold faster declines in cognitive function over time [ 48]. such declines in cognitive performance may be worsened by the presence of diabetes-related comorbid conditions like hypertension [ 49] or macrovascular disease (e.g. carotid imt) [ 50]. the current high level of cognitivediabetologia (2011) 54:245 –255 253function within our study cohort may explain the small amount of variance accounted for by our glycaemic and microvascular predictors. moreover, the absence of astatistically reliable relationship between cognitive change and early macrovascular complications may be a conse- quence of the relatively low prevalence of those complica-tions in this carefully monitored study cohort [ 32]. however, as our patients with type 1 diabetes continue to age, they may show more pronounced evidence ofcognitive decline as their e xposure to chronic hyper- glycaemia increases and their diabetic vascular complica- tions worsen. those diabetic patients who are successful inmaintaining optimal metabolic control and in slowing or preventing the development of complications should also manifest relatively less cognitive decline over time. acknowledgements a complete list of participants in the dcct/ edic research group is included in

article risk of dementia in patients hospitalised with type 1 and type 2 diabetes in england, 1998 –2011: a retrospective national record linkage cohort study kate smolina &clare j. wotton &michael j. goldacre received: 23 october 2014 /accepted: 15 january 2015 /published online: 12 february 2015 #springer-verlag berlin heidelberg 2015 abstract aims/hypothesis type 2 diabetes increases the risk of subse- quent dementia. our objective was to determine whether a similar risk of subsequent dementia is associated with type 1 diabetes in a large defined population. methods this retrospective cohort study examined national administrative record-linked statistical data on hospital care and mortality in england, 1998 –2011. cohorts of people ad- mitted to hospital when aged 30 or over were constructed: 343,062 people with type 1 diabetes; 1,855,141 people with type 2 diabetes; and a refere nce cohort. results were expressed as rate ratios (rr) comparing each diabetes cohort with the control cohort. results the overall rr for dementia in people admitted to hospital with type 1 diabetes was 1.65 (95% ci 1.61, 1.68),and for people admitted to hospital with type 2 diabetes was 1.37 (1.35, 1.38). young age at admission for diabetes ap- peared to confer a greater rate of subsequent dementia; ther rf o rd e m e n t i ai np e o p l ea d m i t t e dt oh o s p i t a lw i t ht y p e1 diabetes aged 30 –39 years was 7.10 (4.65, 10.6), which re- duced to 4.40 (3.55, 5.40) in those aged 40 –49 at admission, and further reduced with increasing age to 1.16 (1.11, 1.20) in those aged 80 or over at admission. a similar pattern was seen with type 2 diabetes.conclusions/interpretation type 1 diabetes, as well as type 2 diabetes, may be associated with an elevated risk of subse-quent dementia. the risk of dementia varies with age at ad- mission to hospital with diabetes, and appears to be much greater in the young. keywords dementia .diabetes .record linkage .risk . type 1 .type 2 abbreviations ad alzheimer ’sd i s e a s e hes hospital episode statistics nhs national health servicerr rate ratio introduction an increasing incidence of type 1 diabetes in children has been documented around the world, and rates are projected to increase further [ 1–5]. at the population level, the increas- ing incidence will lead to a higher prevalence of adults with type 1 diabetes in the future, and consequently a higher rate of complications associated with type 1 diabetes. while many ofthese complications are known [ 6], important clinical ques- tions remain. specifically, it is not clear whether type 1 diabe- tes is associated with an increased risk of dementia in the same way as type 2 diabetes [ 7]; if it is, what is the risk and how does it change with age? two common types of dementia areof interest: alzheimer ’s disease (ad) and vascular dementia. there has been much research interest in dementia risk in people with diabetes mellitus. the association between thetwo conditions has been established and quantified [ 8–10]. however, the overwhelming majority of published studies focused on type 2 diabetes. while the biological connectionelectronic

studies of the riskof different types of dementia in individuals with type 1 diabetes. we sought to fill this gap by analysing national hospital statistics for england (population approximately 50 million). retrospective analysis of administrative health data allowed for the construction of a very large cohort of individuals withtype 1 diabetes, which would be difficult to accomplish through other study designs. furthermore, it allowed for strat- ification of results by age group and, thus, for tracking howrisk changes throughout life. we report our findings by age group, diabetes type and dementia type. methods population and data we undertook a retrospective cohort analysis using a dataset of english national hospital episode statistics (hes) linked to a dataset of all deaths in england during the period 1 april 1998 to 31 december 2011 [ 14]. the hes data include clin- ical, demographic and administrative patient information on all hospital admissions, including day cases (people admitted who do not stay overnight), in all uk national health service(nhs) hospitals. the hes data were supplied by the english national health and social care information centre. the linked dataset was built by the oxford record linkage groupusing, as identifiers, the encrypted nhs number (unique to each individual) and encrypted postcode, date of birth and sex. mortality data derive from death registration records suppliedby the office for national statistics, with identifiers encrypted in the same way, and linked into the hes dataset. the file includes deaths registered up to 31 december 2011. themethods used were similar to those described in previous studies [ 15,16], and were, briefly, as follows. a cohort of people with type 1 diabetes was constructed by identifying each person ’s first recorded episode of day-case care or inpatient admission for type 1 diabetes, coded in any diagnostic field on the discharge abstract, when aged 30 orolder, and with no diagnosis of type 2 diabetes on the same record (to increase the accuracy of categorisation of diabetes type). we excluded those under the age of 30 in the principal analyses because the number of dementia cases in this age group was very small and rates had very wide cis —the study period was not long enough to allow young individuals time to develop dementia. however, we still report data on these peo- ple in the results. the same approach was used for the type 2 diabetes cohort, except that records were excluded if the first record also had a recorded diagnosis of type 1 diabetes. the cohorts willsubsequently be referred to, collectively, as the ‘diabetes cohorts ’, for brevity. the icd-10 codes used were e10 for type 1 diabetes and e11 for type 2 diabetes ( www.who.int/classifications/icd/en/ ). a reference cohort was constructed by identifying the first admission for each individual with various other medical and surgical conditions and injuries (see footnote in table 2). this is based on a ‘reference group ’of conditions that has been used in other studies of disease associations [ 15,17]. the standard epidemiological practice was followed for hospitalcontrols: selecting a diverse range of conditions rather than a narrow range (in case the latter are themselves atypical in the associated risk of dementia). we searched the dataset for anysubsequent nhs hospital care for, or death from, dementia (the‘outcome ’disease) in the diabetes and the reference co- horts. the icd codes used for all dementia in the icd-9(www.icd9data.com/2007/volume1 ) and icd-10 were 290 and 331.0 and f00-f01 and f03 and g30 (icd-9 was used for deaths in 1999 and 2000 and icd-10 for deaths from 2001;icd-10 was used for hospital discharge data throughout the period covered by this study). these codes include ad (290 in icd-9 and f00 and g30 in icd-10), vascular dementia (f01)and unspecified dementia (290 in icd-9 and f03 in icd-10). we considered dementia cases to be those coded as the prin- cipal or a secondary diagnosis on the discharge abstract. we subdivided those with an admission for dementia into those who were specifically recorded as having an admission forad (331.0 in icd-9 and f00 and g30 in icd-10) and those recorded as having an admission for vascular dementia (290.4 in icd-9 and f01 in icd-10). people were included in thediabetes or the reference cohorts if they did not have an ad- mission for dementia either before or at the same time as the admission for diabetes or the reference condition, respectively. this was done with the intention of identifying, as best as was possible, the likelihood that diabetes truly preceded dementia. for the same reason, and to reduce the possibility of surveil-lance bias (the possibility that dementia might be diagnosed early after an admission for diabetes because the person was under clinical observation), we excluded cases of dementiathat occurred within 2 years of the first recorded admission for diabetes. the only exception to this was in the analyses of time intervals, where we specifically looked at diabetes casesoccurring within 2 years of admission for dementia, in order to give a complete picture of time-interval data from then until 10 or more years after the index admission. we analysed the data for men and women separately, as well as together, and at different time intervals between first admission for diabetes and first subsequent admission for de-mentia. in addition, we analysed the data when each diabetes subtype was coded only as the principal reason for admission (i.e. the person was admitted for the principal reason of man-aging the diabetes itself), rather than as a secondary diagnosis (i.e. was present but the person was admitted principally for a complication of it or for another condition).diabetologia (2015) 58:942 –950 943statistical analysis in comparing the diabetes cohorts with the reference cohort, we stratified and then st andardised by age (in 5-year age groups), sex, calendar year of first recorded admission, region of resi- dence and quintile of patients ’index of deprivation score (a standard measure of socioeconomic status used in england). statistical methods are given in detail elsewhere [ 16]. the first set of calculations compared the cohorts within the individual strata (e.g. within 5-year age groups, single year of hospital admission). the direct method of standardisation was used with the combined diabetes and reference cohort as the standard pop-ulation. the stratum-specific rates were then applied to the num- ber of people in each stratum with in, first, the diabetes cohorts, and then, separately, the reference cohort. this calculation gavethe expected number of cases of dementia in each stratum in the diabetes and reference cohorts. the observed and expected num- bers within each stratum were then summed to give the totals inthe broader age groups shown in the tables and then at all ages. results are expressed as rate ratios (rrs) comparing the diabetes cohorts with the reference cohort, using the formula(o diab/ediab)/(oref/eref), where oandeare the observed and ex- pected numbers of dementia in the diabetes and reference cohorts, respectively. the calculation of expected values, the rrs, their cis and pvalues used standard published statistical methods [ 18]. ethical approval for the programme of work linking and analysing routine medical datasets was obtained from the cen- tral and south bristol multi-ce ntre research ethics committee (04/q2006/176). results in our dataset, there were 343,062 people with a hospital ad- mission record of type 1 diabetes mellitus between 1998 and 2011 in england, and 1,855,141 people with type 2 diabetesmellitus (table 1). the sex distribution was similar across both diabetes types, with men representing just over a half of all cases. the ratio ofcontrols to cases varied by age but, as the analyses were all done within age strata, this is immaterial. for example, the risk of dementia in the 32,018 people in the diabetes type 1 agegroup aged 30 –39 was compared with the risk in 864,486 (32,018×27) people in the reference cohort; and the risk in the 554,157 people with type 2 diabetes aged 70 –79 was com- pared with around 550,000 people in the same age group in the reference cohort (table 1). we examined the rrs for de- mentia in those with diabetes compared with those without diabetes by age and over time. table 2shows the adjusted rrs for different types of dementia by type of diabetes andage group. table 3illustrates how the overall rrs for different types of dementia changed over time by type of diabetes. the summary of results below is organised by type of diabetes.type 1 diabetes age at admission there was a significantly elevated overall risk of dementia in people with type 1 diabetes (rr 1.65; 95% ci 1.61, 1.68) (table 2). the rr was highest in people ad- mitted to hospital with type 1 diabetes when aged 30 –39 (7.10; 4.65, 10.6) and gradually decreased as age increased, with a much lower rr for those aged 80 or older (1.16; 1.11, 1.20). there was a small but significant elevated overall riskof ad (rr 1.10; 1.05, 1.15). similarly, the risk was greatest in those aged 30 –39 and reduced with increasing age. for those aged 80 or older, the risk was no longer statistically signifi-cant; in fact, there was a reduced risk of ad in this age group (0.84; 0.76, 0.92). there was a twofold elevation in overall risk of vascular dementia (2.21; 2.13, 2.28) (table 2). the risk of vascular dementia reduced with increasing age from 14.0 (5.04, 36.5) in those aged 30 –39 to 1.34 (1.25, 1.45) in those aged 80 or older at admission. time interval between type 1 diabetes admission and subsequent dementia admission the rr for any dementia was highest when recorded within 2 years of a hospital admission with type 1 diabetes diagnosis (1.96; 1.91, 2.02) (table 3); but for the majority of the analyses, we excluded these cases. the rr reduced gradually as the interval between diabetes admissionand dementia admission increased, but the overall risk of de- mentia remained significantly elevated 10 and more years after admission for type 1 diabetes (rr 1.41; 1.32, 1.51).the results for vascular dementia followed a similar pattern, with the rr decreasing from 2.53 (2.41, 2.65) within the first 2 years of diabetes admission to 1.99 (1.78, 2.21) at 10 ormore years after admission. the elevated risk of ad was only seen up to 4 years after diabetes admission. type 2 diabetes age at admission there was a significantly elevated overall risk of dementia in people with type 2 diabetes (rr 1.37; 1.35, 1.38) (table 2). the rr decreased with increasing age from 5.59 (3.33, 8.99) in those aged 30 –39 to 1.10 (1.09, 1.12) in those aged 80 or over. there was no significant elevation in the overall risk of ad in people with type 2 diabetes, with an rr of 0.99 (0.97, 1.01). the risk of ad appeared to be mean-ingfully elevated only for those aged 50 – 69, raising the pos- sibility that type 2 diabetes may not be a risk factor for ad in older individuals. similarly to the individuals with type 1 di-abetes, the risk of vascular dementia was significantly elevat- ed in individuals with type 2 diabetes (rr 1.80; 1.77, 1.83), with the risk decreasing as the age increased. time interval between type 2 diabetes admission and subsequent dementia admission the rr for any dementia was highest944 diabetologia (2015) 58:942 –950when the admission occurred within 2 years of a hospital admission with type 2 diabetes diagnosis (1.43; 1.41, 1.46)(table 3). there was a gradual reduction in the overall demen- tia risk with increasing time, with the rr remaining signifi- cantly elevated 10 or more years after diabetes admission.there was an elevated risk of ad that was only seen within 2 years of diabetes admission. for vascular dementia, the rr was generally stable across all time intervals. further sub-analyses we performed a sensitivity analysis by examining the data when diabetes was coded as a principaldiagnosis on the record only, rather than a diagnosis found in any position on the record, and found that the resultant rrs were slightly higher than those reported as the main findingsof this study (table 4). the likely explanation is that including only those who were principally admitted to hospital for dia- betes, as distinct from having diabetes as a recorded comor-bidity, probably means that the study cohort comprised pa- tients with more severe diabetes. we analysed the data separately for men and women in each age group, but found no appreciable differences (elec- tronic supplementary material [esm table 1]). finally, we analysed the dataset for dementia in people with diabetes under the age of 30 years within the limits of our period of follow up. of 69,613 people with type 1 diabetes aged under 30, there were 3.4 expected cases, 15 observed andan rr of 4.93 (2.65, 8.54); of 17,695 people under 30 with type 2 diabetes, there were 0.7 expected cases, eight observed and an rr of 11.9 (4.98, 24.4). discussion this study reports rrs for different types of dementia by age group and diabetes type for individuals with a hospitaladmission record containing a di abetes and/or dementia diag- nosis between 1998 and 2011 in england. the results show thattype 1 diabetes may be a risk fac tor for dementia, with an rr for any dementia of 1.65, ad 1.10 and vascular dementia 2.21. type 2 diabetes was also confirmed as a risk factor for demen-tia. for both diabetes types, there was a much higher rr in relatively young people that reduced with increasing age. type 1 diabetes as a risk factor for dementia the findings of this study indicate that type 1 diabetes is associated with an elevated risk of any dementia, ad andvascular dementia. we cannot compare our findings with those reported in the literature because we were not able to identify any studies that estimated the risk of dementia in apopulation of individuals with type 1 diabetes. cardiovascular complications of type 1 diabetes are well established and thus the association of type 1 diabetes with vascular dementia isbiologically plausible. it is also known that type 1 diabetes is associated with cognitive impairment [ 10,11]. therefore, our findings are in line with current understanding of the naturalhistory of type 1 diabetes and the subsequent development of vascular disease. two recent meta-analyses of studies on the association of diabetes (both types combined) and dementia [ 7,9]r e p o r t e d the following relative risks, respectively: 1.51 (1.31, 1.74) and 1.73 (1.65, 1.82) for any dementia; 1.46 (1.20, 1.77) and 1.56 (1.41, 1.73) for ad; 2.48 (2.08, 2.96) and 2.27 (1.94, 2.66) for vascular dementia. while our estimates for risk of dementiafor type 2 diabetes are lower than the overall figures reported in these meta-analyses, they fall within the range of estimates reported by the individual studies included in the meta-analy-ses. this provides evidence that our rr estimates for type 1 diabetes are reasonable. however, given the lower estimates for type 2 diabetes, the true elevated risk of dementia amongtable 1 age and sex

5-year bands, rather than those showed, for brevity, in the table)diabetologia (2015) 58:942 –950 945individuals with type 1 diabetes is likely to be even higher than is reported here. given the limit ations of the methods (discussed below), and the fact that associations between type 1 diabetes and vascular dementia were stronger and more clearly present at long time intervals than those with ad, we consider that theevidence is stronger for vascular dementia than for ad. published reports on the association between type 2 diabe- tes and ad are inconsistent. our estimate of risk of ad in individuals with type 2 diabetes (rr 0.99, 0.97, 1.01) sug- gests there is no association between the two conditions. it isworth noting that in most of the studies included in recent systematic evaluations of published literature, the cis for ad risk include 1.0 [ 7,9,19]. the understanding of the biological mechanisms that un- derpin the association between diabetes and dementia is in- complete. both are complex conditions influenced by a varietyof environmental, genetic and biological factors, as well as the interaction of those factors [ 20]. a number of possible mecha- nisms that are potentially involv ed with cognitive dysfunction have been identified for both types of diabetes [ 12,13]. in addition, the degree of cognitive impairment has been shownto depend on the age of diabetes onset, and thus its duration, and how well glucose levels are maintained [ 11–13]. duration of diabetes, which is typicall y longer for those affected with type 1 because they are relatively young at onset, could be a critical factor behind the higher risk of developing dementiaamong people with type 1 than type 2 diabetes. changing risk with age we found that the influence of diabetes —both type 1 and type 2—on the risk of dementia decreases with increasing age.table 2 occurrence of dementia in individuals aged 30 or over with a hospital record for diabetes, and subdivided into

that it was lower in individuals aged 65 and over than in individuals younger than 65 [ 21,22]. a recent analysis of data from west- ern australia that examined survival outcomes in dementiapatients, based on history of diabetes (but without specifica- tion of type), demonstrated that the impact of diabetes on dementia gradually decreases with increasing age [ 23]. the study concluded that it is the early onset of diabetes that is accountable for much of the increased risk of dementia in younger age groups, as opposed to a major change in thenatural history of diabetes-related dementia. sensitivity analysis although our main results were derived from the analysis of records with any mention of diabetes diagnosis, we addition-ally analysed the data for records where diabetes was the prin- cipal reason for admission to hospital. we did this to test the robustness of the results in the absence of other serious co-morbid diseases that may actually have been associated with dementia. we found that the rrs were actually slightly higher when using the principal diagnosis of diabetes only, reassuringus that our main reported findings were not due to associations between dementia and other serious comorbid conditions. strengths and limitations the strengths of our datasets include the large size of the study population, the complete national representation, the inclusion of all ages; and that it comprises recent data. it included over one-third of a million people with type 1 diabetes and nearly two million with type 2. to the best of our knowledge, this is the first study to report estimates of dementia risk for individ-uals with type 1 diabetes. further, we believe that this is also the first study to report age-specific rrs for different types of dementia in patients with different types of diabetes from thesame population. the reference cohort has been used exten- sively in previous studies and has been shown to report plau- sible rates for a variety of conditions [ 15–17]. furthermore,our obtained rr estimates for type 2 diabetes, although lower, are in agreement with the literature, thus lending credibility to our estimates for type 1 diabetes. it is possible that there is some surveillance bias in our study —the identification of cases of dementia soon after a diagnosis of diabetes —but this alone would not explain similarities between our findings at longer follow up and the literature on type 2 diabetes in studieswith different designs. one of the main limitations was the incomplete capture of all cases of diabetes and dementia th at occurred in england during the study period, due to the dataset being limited to people admitted to hospital or receiving day case specialist care. as such, absolute rates of dementia among people with diabetescannot be calculated, but relative rates can. of the individuals in the reference cohort, 1.1% subsequently had a record of diabe- tes and moved to the exposure cohort, i.e. there was a preva-lence of hospitalised diabetes of 1.1% in individuals otherwise eligible to be in the reference cohort. survey data show that the prevalence of diagnosed diabetes increased in england from 3.3% to 6.3% in men, and from 2.5% to 5.3% in women, between 1998 and 2010 [ 24]. therefore, our prevalence is an underestimate because our dataset does not include people ad- mitted to hospital outside of the study period. a recent study reported that approximately 60% of patients with type 2 diabe-tes are hospitalised at least once during a 4 year period [ 25]. our study period was substantially longer than that, and we likely captured the majority of people with type 2 diabetes in england. it is possible that some diabetes-type and dementia-type cases in our data were misdiagnosed. because of the nature of administrative data and its collection, there will inevitablybe some misdiagnosis or miscoding. unfortunately, privacy regulations preclude independent checking of samples of di- agnoses, and their diagnostic basis, in medical records byresearchers. it is worth noting that the lack of diagnostic spec- ificity of dementia type affected both cases and controls, and would probably have a limited impact on the rrs comparingthe two. we were also not able to control for unrecorded risk factors (e.g. smoking) in our analysis. it is uncertain how this might have affected

the results strongly suggest that type 1 diabetes, as wellas type 2 diabetes, increases the risk of subsequent vascular dementia. the evidence for this is particularly strong in the findings in the relatively young age groups. the rrs for vas-cular dementia observed among those aged 40 –59 (table 2) were both significantly high in their own right (compared with the reference cohort) and also significantly higher than thosefor ad in the corresponding age groups. we suggest that these results point to a real association between type 1 diabetes and vascular dementia because it is unlikely that such high rrscould be a sole product of misclassification of type 2 as type 1 or other uncontrolled confounding factors. conclusion this study adds new evidence that type 1 diabetes is probably associated with dementia. it also shows how the risk of de-mentia changes with age, and that the association between diabetes and dementia is particularly strong in people with diabetes when young. our findings suggest a much strongerassociation between type 1 diabetes and vascular dementia than with ad. given that the presented findings are based on hospital statistics alone, further research is required to con-firm or refute these associations in the whole population of people with diabetes. acknowledgements the linked data sets were built over many years by leicester gill and matt

(to convert hba 1clevel to a pro- portion of total hemoglobin, multiply by 0.01.) methods participants study participants consisted of 123 adult patients with t1dm and 38 healthy control subjects. patients with t1dm who con-secutively visited the joslin diabetes center, boston, massa-chusetts, and mclean hospital’s brain imaging center, bel- mont, massachusetts, from january 2003 through june 2005,who were between the ages of 25 and 40 years, and who had adisease duration of 15 to 25 years were eligible for the initialinclusion. diabetic complications that served as exclusion criteria in- cluded proliferative diabetic retinopathy requiring laser treat-ment, clinically significant diabetic nephropathy (evidenced byurinary albumin to creatinine ratio /h11022300 µg/mg or serum cre- atinine levels /h110221.5 mg/dl for men and /h110221.4 mg/dl for women [to convert to micromoles per liter, multiply by 88.4]), pain-ful or symptomatic neuropathy, or gastroparesis. potential par-ticipants with major medical and neurologic disorders and con-traindications to magnetic resonance (mr) imaging wereexcluded, as were those with a history of psychosis, schizo-phrenia, bipolar disorder, attention-deficit/hyperactivity dis-order, or cocaine, heroin, or alcohol dependence or with a cur-rent major depressive episode as assessed with the structuredclinical interview for dsm-iv . 25patients with hypoglycemic symptoms or diabetic ketoacidosis at the time of imaging werealso excluded. the study was approved by respective institutional com- mittees on human subjects, and all subjects gave informed con-sent prior to participation. neuropsychological and clinical assessments a battery of neuropsychological tests was administered to assess 3 cognitive domains: memory function, executive func-tion, and psychomotor speed. after adjusting for age, sex com-position, and educational level, scores of each neuropsycho-logical test were converted to zscores with the use of group means and standard deviations of healthy control subjects. ifnecessary, test scores were reversed to indicate better perfor-mances with positive zscores. the composite score for memory function was made by av- eraging zscores of the immediate memory and the delayed re- call from the wechsler memory scale iii. 26the composite score for executive function was constructed by averaging zscores of the trail-making number-letter switching, verbal fluency, de-sign fluency, card-word interference, and card sorting from thedelis-kaplan executive function system 27; the digit symbol sub- stitution from the wechsler adult intelligence scale28; and the letter-number sequencing and spatial span from the wechslermemory scale iii. 26the composite score for psychomotor speed was calculated by averaging zscores of the dominant and non- dominant hand on the grooved pegboard test.29the compound score for the global cognitive function was calculated by aver-aging zscores of composite scores of the 3 cognitive domains. internal consistency of the neuropsychological tests within each cognitive domain was assessed by means of cronbach /h9251 coefficient analysis. cronbach /h9251coefficients for memory func- tion, executive function, and psychomotor speed were 0.89, 0.82,and 0.71, respectively. the 17-item hamilton depression rating scale 30was used to assess current depressive symptoms. lifetime average hba 1clevel, which reflects the level of life- time glycemic control, was defined as the average value of hba 1c levels, grouped and time-weighted every 4 years for the entireduration of the disease. 31patients with t1dm were divided into 2 subgroups on the basis of whether the level of lifetime glyce-mic control was good (ie, within target [lifetime average hba 1c level/h110217%]) or poor ( /h113507%).24a severe hypoglycemic episode was defined as an event that leads to a coma or to unconscious-ness, on the basis of the diabetes control and complications trialresearch group criteria. 31-33date of diagnosis was obtained from (reprinted) arch gen psychiatry/ vol 66 (no. 8), aug 2009 www.archgenpsychiatry.com 879 ©2009 american medical association. all rights reserved.downloaded from jamanetwork.com by viktor savenkov on 01/13/2025medical records or patient self-report. hand preference was evalu- ated by the edinburgh handedness inventory.34 current hba 1clevels, measured approximately 30 minutes before the start of mr imaging, were used as a measure of re-cent ambient blood glucose levels in the present study. de-tailed methods and results for the acquisition of data pertain-ing to the relationship between recent peripheral glycemia andprefrontal glucose levels are described in esupplement 1 (http://www.archgenpsychiatry.com). mr image acquisition and proton mrs the mr imaging was conducted at the mclean brain imagingcenter with the use of a 1.5-t whole-body imaging system (ho-rizon lx; ge medical systems, milwaukee, wisconsin). all im-ages were obtained with the use of a custom-made linear bird-cage coil with approximately 40% improvement in the signalto noise ratio and improved homogeneity over a standard qua-drature head coil. 35a 3-dimensional spoiled gradient echo pulse sequence was used to produce 124 contiguous coronal im-ages, 1.5 mm thick (echo time [te], 5 milliseconds; repetitiontime [tr], 35 milliseconds; matrix, 256 /h11003192; field of view [fov], 24 cm; flip angle [fa], 45°; and number of excitations[nex], 1). axial t2-weighted images (te, 80 milliseconds; tr,3000 milliseconds;

01/13/2025homeostasis of the glutamatergic system may be of ben- efit in preventing low cognitive performance in patientswith diabetes. 49,50interestingly, n-methyl- d-aspartic acid receptor antagonists have recently been used in slowingcognitive decline in alzheimer disease. 23,51 prefrontal glucose levels, which were also higher in patients with t1dm, were not related to cognitive func-tion in analyses of patients with t1dm and t1dm sub-groups. patients with more poorly controlled diabetes whohave a lifetime average hba 1clevel greater than 8%, how- ever, showed a negative association between prefrontalglucose levels and cognitive function. this exploratoryanalysis indirectly suggests the presence of a thresholdfor glycemic control or a range of cerebral glucose levelsat which cerebral glucose may directly affect cognitivefunction in patients with t1dm. depression affects up to 25% of patients with t1dm, 6,7 increasing diabetic complications and mortality as well asdecreasing overall quality of life. 5-7although poor glyce- mic control is regarded as a risk factor for depression,6its mechanism remains to be further clarified.7associations between dysregulated glutamatergic system and mild de-pressive symptoms, observed in the present study, may pro-vide clues to uncovering a neurochemical mechanism ofdepression in t1dm. because depression in patients withmedical disorders is often resistant to standard treat-ments, 52alternative treatment options may be suggested in view of the current findings. considering that the gluta-matergic system has recently emerged as an important tar-get for drug development, particularly in mood disorderswith an atypical nature, 53-55drugs acting on the glutama- tergic system, such as ketamine hydrochloride, la-motrigine, and riluzole, 56may have the potential to help improve depressive symptoms in patients with t1dm. our findings in patients with t1dm are different from those of a recent study on depressed patients with type2 diabetes, which reported decreased glx resonances insubcortical brain regions. 57this discrepancy may stem from several factors, including differences in sample char-acteristics, such as age, type of diabetes, comorbid medi-cal conditions, and presence of current depression; in mrsmethods used; and in brain regions examined. in the present study, prefrontal glx levels were 9.0% higher in patients with t1dm than in healthy control sub-jects, and they increased uniformly as the level of glycemiccontrol worsened from normal through good to poor (4.2%and 10.0% of glx level increment compared with healthycontrol subjects, respectively). a similar pattern of uniformincreases in prefrontal glucose levels was observed. we reasoned that sustained exposure to hyperglyce- mia would alter cerebral energy metabolism and changecerebral metabolite levels. considering that high intracel-lular glucose concentrations lead to increased oxidativephosphorylation and, possibly, an accelerated glutamate-glutamine cycle, 16high prefrontal glutamate levels in pa- tients with t1dm are likely to stem from increased de novosynthesis, ie, cellular adaptations to hyperglycemia. pre-clinical evidence indicates that elevated glucose levels in-crease cerebral glutamate levels and that this link, ulti-mately, contributes to neuronal damage in diabetic as wellas ischemic conditions. 58-60data from the current study sug- gest that keeping glycemic control in the near-normal rangeis likely to help diabetic patients maintain optimal prefron- tal glutamate levels, which may then reduce the risk of hav-ing lower cognitive performance. high prefrontal glx concentrations in patients with t1dm may be attributed in part to t1dm-specific condi-tions. patients with t1dm frequently have antibodies togad, 18,61the rate-limiting enzyme that catalyzes the de- carboxylation of glutamate to /h9253-aminobutyric acid. these autoimmune abnormalities may lead to excessive gluta-mate accumulations. 62consequently, patients with t1dm, especially those with high levels of gad antibodies, maybe vulnerable to glutamate-induced neuronal damage. patients with t1dm have been reported to have high cerebral myo-inositol levels. 13,14considering myo- inositol’s function as an osmotic agent and a storage formfor glucose, 17,63-65an increase in myo-inositol levels may reflect osmotic changes in the brain or inadequate gly-cemic control in patients with t1dm. although there wasno difference in prefrontal myo-inositol levels between subjects in our t1dm and control groups, patients witht1dm with a lifetime hba 1clevel higher than 8% showed a higher myo-inositol:cr ratio than healthy control sub- jects ( f1,93=4.41, p=.04). this is partly in accord with a previous report that suggested that myo-inositol may work as a cerebral osmolyte, particularly in diabetic patientswith poor glycemic control. 66 several potential confounding factors should be con- sidered in interpreting our results. although hypergly-cemia-induced microvascular and macrovascular com-plications are relatively uncommon in patients before theage of 40 years, 2vascular injury in the brain may have contributed to the occurrence of low cognitive perfor-mance and depression. in our recent study, conductedwith a similar but smaller t1dm cohort, 32however, we did not find an increased prevalence of brain t2 whitematter hyperintensities, which are indirect markers of vas-cular injury. in addition, the relatively young ages (mean,32.3 years) and short disease durations (mean, 19.9 years)of our patients with t1dm lessen the likelihood of theconfounding by aging and cerebral vascular changes. although cognitive function in patients with t1dm may be influenced by previous severe hypoglycemic epi-sodes, 2this association was not confirmed in a recent large- scale longitudinal trial.8,67in the present study, the num- ber or pattern of hypoglycemic episodes was not associatedwith cognitive function. mild ketosis, which frequently occurs in patients with t1dm, 68-70can influence cerebral glutamate metabo- lism. in cerebral ketone body metabolism, glutamate istransformed to /h9253-aminobutyric acid through the gad pathway. 71,72reduced gad activity in patients with t1dm62may further contribute to increases in cerebral glutamate levels.71,72 depressive symptoms in our patients with t1dm might be psychological responses to chronic medical disor-ders. 73also, because our patients with t1dm had rela- tively mild depression and were not diagnosed as

resonance at 1.5-t imaging.16,63,74 because plasma glucose levels were measured in a sub- set of patients with t1dm, the immediate effects of periph-eral glucose levels cannot be effectively controlled in thepresent study assessing long-term effects of hyperglycemiaon cerebral glucose metabolism (see esupplement 1 for de-tails). more controlled conditions, such as those using theexperimental clamping technique during mr examination,would be necessary to accurately control for the confound-ing influence of the peripheral glucose levels—especiallyextreme hypoglycemia or hyperglycemia—on evaluatinglong-termcerebralmetabolicchangesinpatientswitht1dm. the present mrs study, conducted with a large t1dm cohort, has shown that prefrontal glx level is increased inadult patients with t1dm compared with healthy controlsubjects. higher prefrontal glx levels are associated withlower cognitive function and depressive symptoms in adultpatientswitht1dm.randomizedcontrolledstudiesarenec-essary to confirm the causal relationship between the levelof glycemic control and cerebral glutamate changes. future studies are also recommended to evaluate the effectiveness of therapeutic options acting on glutama-tergic neurotransmission in the treatment or preventionof cns-related changes in patients with t1dm. in addition, our findings show that patients with t1dm who maintain glycemic control within the recom-mended treatment target of hba 1cless than 7% would have the benefit of keeping optimal prefrontal gluta-mate levels, thereby potentially reducing the risk of cns-related changes. a randomized clinical trial assessing thecausal relationship between glycemic control and cere-bral glutamate levels could confirm our interpretation. submitted for publication: june 19, 2008; final revision received february 9, 2009; accepted february 11, 2009.author affiliations: department of psychiatry and in- terdisciplinary

functional brain connectivity and neurocognitive functioning in patients with long-standing type 1diabetes with and without microvascular complications a magnetoencephalography study eelco van duinkerken,1martin klein,2niki s.m. schoonenboom,3roel p.l.m. hoogma,4 annette c. moll,5frank j. snoek,2cornelis j. stam,3and michaela diamant6 objective —hyperglycemia-associated microvascular disease may underlie changes in cerebral functioning and cognitiveperformance in patients with type 1 diabetes. functional connec-tivity, an indicator of functional interactions and informationexchange between brain regions, provides a measure of cerebralfunctioning. this study addresses functional connectivity andcognition in type 1 diabetic patients with and without prolifera-tive retinopathy, relative to healthy control subjects, usingmagnetoencephalography. research design and methods —fluctuations in mag- netic ﬁeld at scalp for /h9004,/h9258, lower and upper /h9251,/h9252, and lower and upper /h9253frequency bands were measured using magnetoencepha- lography. synchronization likelihood, a measure of functionalconnectivity, was computed. using neuropsychological tests,cognitive functioning was assessed and its associations withfunctional connectivity were determined. results —compared with control subjects, type 1 diabetic patients performed poorer on general cognitive ability, informa-tion processing speed, and motor speed, irrespective of theirmicrovascular complication status. functional connectivity,however, was lowest for type 1 diabetic patients with retinopa-thy, compared with type 1 diabetic patients without microvascu-lar complications and control subjects, whereas type 1 diabeticpatients without microvascular complications showed an in-crease relative to control subjects. positive associations werefound between functional connectivity and executive function-ing, memory, information processing speed, motor speed, andattention. conclusions —compared with healthy control subjects, functional connectivity and cognition differed in type 1 diabeticpatients irrespective of microvascular complication status, indi-cating that chronic hyperglycemia, among other factors, maynegatively affect brain functioning even before microvasculardamage becomes manifest. the association found between syn- chronization likelihood and cognition suggests functional con-nectivity plays a signiﬁcant role in cognitive functioning.diabetes 58:2335–2343, 2009 mild cognitive deterioration and changes in cerebral anatomy have been demonstrated inpatients with long-standing type 1 diabetes.these cognitive disturbances are limited to slowed information processing speed, attentional func-tioning, and primary motor as well as psychomotor speed(1–3). using structural magnetic resonance imaging (mri),reductions in cerebral gray and white matter volume intype 1 diabetes compared with healthy control subjectswere reported (4–6). to measure important functionalchanges, electroencephalography can be used. in childrenwith type 1 diabetes, increases in slow ( /h9004and/h9258) activity, decreases in fast ( /h9251,/h9252, and /h9253frequency bands) activity, and a reduction in /h9251peak frequency were found. these functional cerebral changes were correlated with bothpoor glycemic control and more episodes of severe hypo-glycemia (7). compared with healthy control subjects,there was a loss of fast activity in well-controlled diabeticadults (8). these changes were unrelated to a history ofsevere hypoglycemic events. although the underlying neu-ropathological and biological substrates are undeﬁned,there is evidence that chronic hyperglycemia, leading tomicroangiopathy in the brain, may be the main cause ofthese cerebral complications (3,5,6,9). a relatively novel and more advanced approach to measuring brain activity is magnetoencephalography(meg). meg measures ﬂuctuations of magnetic ﬁelds ofthe brain at the scalp. meg has been widely used in thestudy of functional changes associated with neurologicaldisorders including alzheimer’s disease (10), parkinson’sdisease (11), brain tumors (12), and metabolic disorderssuch as obesity (13,14) and hepatic encephalopathy (15). with meg data, functional connectivity can be calcu- lated. this refers to the assumption that correlationsbetween time series of neural activity recorded fromdifferent brain regions reﬂect functional interactions andinformation exchange between these regions (16,17). dif-ferences in functional connectivity indicate a different wayof communication between brain areas. functional con-nectivity has been thought to be a core component ofcognitive functioning, as most cognitive functions highlydepend on interactions between distinct cerebral regionsrather than on single brain regions or structures. there- from the1department of medical psychology and endocrinology, vu univer- sity

and changes in functional connec-tivity might account for cognitive deterioration (18). in this study, meg functional connectivity relative to healthy control subjects was investigated in a group oftype 1 diabetic patients with proliferative retinopathy as amarker of hyperglycemia and a group of type 1 diabeticpatients without microvascular complications. further-more, neurocognitive functioning and its association withfunctional connectivity was assessed. based on earlierstudies (9,19) we expected type 1 diabetic patients withproliferative retinopathy to show cognitive deteriorationand lower functional connectivity compared with healthycontrol subjects and type 1 diabetic patients withoutmicrovascular complications. research design and methods fifteen type 1 diabetic patients with proliferative retinopathy, an indicator of microangiopathy resulting from chronic hyperglycemia (type 1 diabetes/h11001), 29 type 1 diabetic patients without manifest microvascular complications (type 1 diabetes/h11002), and 26 healthy control subjects matched for sex and education level enrolled in this study. participants were recruited from the departments of endocrinology and ophthalmology of the vu university medical center,amsterdam, the netherlands (50 patients), the department of internal medi-cine, groene hart hospital, gouda, the netherlands (10 patients), and byadvertisements in diabetes magazines and a national newspaper (10 patients). inclusion criteria were age range 18–55 years, right-handedness, for type 1 diabetic patients a disease duration of at least 10 years, proliferative retinop-athy as described below, or no signs of microvascular complications. masteryof the dutch language was required for all participants. participants wereexcluded if they had a bmi above 35 kg/m 2, current use of drugs affecting cerebral functioning, alcohol abuse (more than 20 g of alcohol per day), psychiatric disorders, anemia, thyroid

netherlands) was performed to screen for retinopathy. for eacheye, one photograph with the macula in the center and one with the optic discin the center were taken (e.v.d.). photographs were rated by an ophthalmol-ogist (a.m.) according to the european diabetes (eurodiab) classiﬁcation(20). only those participants with either an eurodiab classiﬁcation score of 0 (no retinopathy) or of 4 or 5 (proliferative retinopathy or lasercoagu-lation) were included in this study. twenty-four–hour urine collectionswere performed to assess albumin-to-creatinine ratio (acr). the presenceof peripheral neuropathy was ascertained by the physician. type 1diabetes /h11002patients had normoalbuminuria (acr /h110212.5 mg/mmol in men and /h110213.5 mg/mmol in women) and no neuropathy. type 1 diabetes/h11001patients were allowed to have microalbuminuria and/or peripheral neuropathy. hypertension was deﬁned as a systolic blood pressure of 140 mmhg orabove, a diastolic blood pressure of 90 mmhg or above, or the use ofantihypertensive drugs. the study protocol was approved by the medicalethics committee of the vu university medical center, and writteninformed consent was obtained from all participants.study design. before eligible participants received written information on the study, their medical records were screened using the aforementionedcriteria. those willing to participate were additionally interviewed over thetelephone to collect background information including educational level,using a dutch scoring system ranging from 1 to 8. one indicates unﬁnishedprimary school and 8 indicates a completed university study at masters level.as depression may affect cognitive performance, depressive symptoms wereassessed using the center for epidemiological studies scale for depression(ces-d). eligible participants were invited for the ﬁrst visit. during this visit,which took place in the afternoon, fundus photography was performed, bloodsamples were collected, and meg registration was performed. approximately6 weeks after the ﬁrst visit participants returned for neuropsychologicalassessment during a morning visit. all visits took place at the vu universitymedical center. to rule out confounding as a result of extreme blood glucose levels, levels were checked in the type 1 diabetes participants before the start of theneuropsychological assessment and meg registration and had to be between4 and 15 mmol/l (72–270 mg/dl). in case of hypoglycemia, participants wereinstructed to eat 20 g of carbohydrates. in case of hyperglycemia, patientswere instructed to inject 2 units of the participants’ current rapid-actinginsulin analog when blood glucose levels were between 15 and 20 mmol/l(270–362 mg/dl) and 4 units when glucose levels exceeded 20 mmol/l (362 mg/dl). glycemic status was evaluated after 30 min. if hyperglycemia (i.e.,blood glucose /h1135015 mmol/l) would persist, participants were instructed to inject another 2 units of insulin; if hypoglycemia would persist, participantsadditionally had to eat 20 g of carbohydrates. two type 1 diabetes /h11001partici - pants were hyperglycemic before start of the neuropsychological assessmentand one before meg acquisition. one type 1 diabetes /h11002patient indicated symptoms of hypoglycemia during neuropsychological testing. proper glyce- mic status was restored for all patients after the ﬁrst step of the above-mentioned protocol. data of the one participant who experiencedhypoglycemia symptoms during neuropsychological testing were included inall analyses, as this did not change analysis outcomes.neuropsychological assessment. based on earlier type 1 diabetes cognitive research (5,21), as well as clinical neuropsychological practice (22), a batteryof cognitive tests was chosen to measure potential differences in ﬁve majorcognitive domains: memory, information processing speed, executive func-tions, attention, and motor speed. domains were based on an earlier principalcomponent analysis using varimax rotation with kaiser normalization in alarge group of healthy subjects and adjusted according to earlier research(5,21,23). the domain ‘memory’ was assessed by the dutch version of the rey auditory verbal learning test (ralvt) (24), wechsler adult intelligencescale–3rd edition revised (wais-iii-r) digit span forward and backward (25),and the wais-iii-r symbol substitution incidental learning test (25). thedomain ‘information processing speed’ was created using the wais-iii-rsymbol substitution test (25), the stroop color-word test parts 1 and 2 (26),the concept shifting task (cst) parts a and b (27), the simple auditory andvisual reaction time tests (28), and the computerized visual searching task(cvst) (28). assessment of the domain ‘executive functions’ was conductedusing the stroop color-word test part 3 (26), the cst part c (27), the d2-testtotal errors (29), the wisconsin cart sorting test (30), and the category wordfluency task (31). the domain ‘attention’ was assessed using the d2-testrange, with total correct answers and total span (29). the domain ‘motorspeed’ consisted of the tapping test (28) and the cst part 0, administeredthree times (27). ‘general cognitive ability’ was constructed by averaging theabove mentioned ﬁve domains. to enhance comparability and allow construction of these domains, z-scores for every test were created based on the means /h11006sd of the healthy control group. higher z-scores indicate better performance.meg protocol. meg data were obtained using a 151-channel whole-head meg system (ctf systems; port coquitlam, bc, canada), while participantswere in a supine position in a magnetically shielded room (vacuumschmelze,hanau, germany). a third-order software gradient (32) was used with arecording passband of 0.25–125 hz and a sample frequency of 625 hz.participants had to be free of any metal materials. magnetic ﬁelds wererecorded for 2 min in an eyes-open, 5 min in an eyes-closed, 10 min in a task,and then 3 min in another eyes-closed condition. total acquisition time was 20min. at the beginning, middle, and end of each recording, the head positionrelative to the coordinate system of the helmet was determined by leadingsmall alternating currents through three head position coils attached to theleft and right preauricular points and the nasion on the subjects head. changesin head position of /h110111.5 cm during a recording condition were accepted. if head position changed more than 1.5 cm, recordings had to be repeated. thisdid not happen in this protocol.synchronization likelihood. from the acquired meg data, information about functional connectivity was calculated by means of a mathematicalconstruct, the synchronization likelihood. for a technical description ofsynchronization likelihood see stam and van dijk (33) and montez et al. (34).in short, interactions between two neural networks, for instance the frontal(x) and temporal (y) networks, are of interest. meg data are recorded for allsensors surrounding the head, including those in the frontal and temporalareas. these signals represent the time series x iand yifrom the frontal (x) and temporal (y) areas (fig. 1). it is assumed that x and y more strongly interact when xiand yimore ‘resemble’ each other (square with continuous line in fig. 1). it has been shown, however, that x and y can also interact when xiand yi do not resemble each other (square with the dashed line in fig. 1). this is called generalized synchronization and can be quantiﬁed by computingsynchronization likelihood. parameter settings used for computation of syn-chronization likelihood are based on the frequency content of the data (forparameter settings see montez et al. [34]). synchronization likelihood canrange from p ref(low synchronization) to one (complete synchronization). pref is a value close to zero (zero indicates no synchronization, which is not possible) and was set on 0.01 for all frequency bands.data analysis. for this analysis, 141 of the 151 channels were used. ten channels were deleted as their signals were distorted in some participants.this had no inﬂuence on the calculations. ofﬂine, recordings of the ﬁrsteyes-closed condition were transformed into ascii-ﬁles and imported into thetype 1 diabetes and cerebral functioning 2336 diabetes, vol.

stam, vu university medical center, amsterdam, the netherlands). for each participant ﬁve artifact-free epochs (6.25 s) of4,096 samples were selected by two authors (e.v.d. and n.s.). total data usedwere 31.25 s. with digeegxp synchronization likelihood was calculated (33).synchronization likelihood was calculated between signals recorded at allpossible sensor pairs for /h9004(0.5–4 hz), /h9258(4–8 hz), lower /h9251(8–10 hz), upper /h9251(10–13 hz), /h9252(13–30 hz), lower /h9253(30–45 hz), and upper /h9253(55–80 hz) frequency bands. subsequently, meg sensors were clustered according to their anatomical location, respectively, right and left frontal, central,parietal, temporal, and occipital. average synchronization likelihood val-ues were then obtained for short-distance, intrahemispheric long-distance,and interhemispheric long-distance groups. short-distance group consistedof 10 areas, left and right hemisphere central, frontal, parietal, occipital,and temporal regions. for each of these 10 areas, the synchronization likelihood between all possible pairs of sensors belonging to that area wasaveraged. this resulted in ten, local short-distance synchronization likeli-hood values. average synchronization likelihood for long distances wasobtained by averaging all pair wise synchronization likelihood values ofsensors belonging to two different areas. intrahemispheric long-distancegroup consisted of eight pairs, left and right hemisphere frontoparietal,frontotemporal, parietoocciptal, and temporooccipital. interhemisphericlong-distance group consisted of ﬁve pairs, left to right hemisphere central,parietal, temporal, occipital, and frontal (12,13). see fig. 2 for anatomicallocations. now, synchronization likelihood resembles the likelihood thatthe data obtained from all sensors in the above-deﬁned short-distance andlong-distance groups are synchronized. fig. 1. example of time series of the frontal and temporal network. the

demographical and medical variables were calculated using student’s ttest for independent samples or one-way anova with tukey post hoc test (for continuousvariables) and /h9273 2test (for categorical variables). to determine group differences in neuropsychological performance man- cova was used with all cognitive domains as dependent variables and groupas independent variable. in case of a group difference on a domain, post hocmancova was used to determine which groups differed. synchronization likelihood data were normalized by means of a transfor- mation ln10(x/[1-x]) (35) to allow the use of parametric statistical tests. tominimize statistical tests, for each meg frequency band ancova withrepeated measures was used to determine group differences. for eachfrequency band, three ancovas with repeated measures were performed forintra-, inter-, and local hemispheric connections. repeated measures forintrahemispheric connections consisted of the 8 above-mentioned levels,interhemispheric connections of 5 levels, and local hemispheric connectionsof 10 levels. in case of signiﬁcant interaction ( pvalues of greenhouse-geisser correction for degrees of freedom) or main effects of group with frequencyband, post hoc mancova analysis was used to determine effects of group andspatial location. to determine associations between cognitive functioning andsynchronization likelihood, a procedure proposed by stoffers et al. and usedin other meg research was implemented (11,12). to reduce multiple compar-isons, cognitive domains were added as covariates to the above-mentionedancova with repeated measures method. effects of group on changingcognitive domains and meg regions were determined using mancova tests.positive or negative associations were further calculated using regressionanalysis. to correct for possible confounding inﬂuences, all statistical testswere corrected for age, sex, hypertension, neuropathy, bmi, education level,and depressive symptoms. partial

between functional con- nectivity in different meg frequency bands and cognition,meg statistics were repeated with cognitive domains added as additional covariates for both type 1 diabetesgroups. in

/h9004local ( p/h110050.043) frequency band. further- more, /h9004interhemispheric was related to the domains of memory ( p/h110050.030), information processing speed ( p/h11005 0.040), and motor speed ( p/h110050.014). the lower /h9253local frequency band was related to attention ( p/h110050.047). for executive functions only, signiﬁcant relations with ana-tomical areas were found. in the

tests. discussion this is, to the best of our knowledge, the ﬁrst study usingmeg to assess functional brain connectivity in type 1diabetes. we showed that, compared with sex- and educa-tion-matched type 1 diabetes /h11002patients and control sub - jects, type 1 diabetes/h11001had decreased functional connectivity. this decrease was most profound in the left and right central and parietal areas in the /h9258, lower and upper /h9251, and /h9252frequency bands. moreover, some intra- and interhemispheric differences were found in the lower/h9251and/h9252bands. in contrast, an increase in functional connectivity was found in the lower /h9251band when compar- ing the type 1 diabetes/h11002patients with control subjects. several frequency bands were positively related to cogni- tive domains, indicating these domains to be dependent offunctional connectivity. on cognitive assessment, type 1diabetic patients with and those without proliferativeretinopathy performed signiﬁcantly poorer on informationprocessing speed, motor speed, and general cognitive ability. these deﬁcits are in line with previous research(1,3,36). results are in line with the hypothesis that type 1diabetes /h11001patients show cognitive and cerebral changes. changes found in type 1 diabetes/h11002patients were, however, not hypothesized. when both patient groups were pooled and compared with control subjects, cognitive results didnot change; however, all differences in meg measure-ments, but those in the /h9004intrahemispheric band, lost statistical signiﬁcance (supplementary table 1 aand b, available in an online appendix). this indicates that type 1diabetes /h11002patients largely resemble the control subjects regarding functional connectivity. given the novelty of the technique used, caution is required when it comes to the interpretation of our con-nectivity ﬁndings. as there is currently only one studyavailable that uses our method in metabolic disease, it maybe difﬁcult to put the current ﬁndings into a broaderperspective. in female obese adolescents, signiﬁcant in-creases in functional connectivity in /h9004and/h9252frequency bands were found (13), possibly because of an

has been reported in mri studies of obese adolescents. this is contrary to the decrease wefound in our group. in contrast, in multiple sclerosis adecrease in functional connectivity was reported (37).this might be related to a loss of white matter, one of thecore features of the disease. following this line of reason-ing, our results for the type 1 diabetes /h11001patients could be a consequence of white matter loss, as has been foundearlier in type 1 diabetes/h11001patients than type 1 diabetes/h11002 patients and healthy control subjects (5). conversely, the increase in functional connectivity in type 1 diabetes/h11002 patients might reﬂect a compensatory mechanism, whichfails in type 1 diabetes/h11001patients. because of large inter - individual differences in cognitive performance, this com-pensation was not observed in cognitive functioning.therefore, larger samples are needed to enable the detec- fig. 4. schematic brain with between-group differences in

of signiﬁcant differences between type 1 diabetes/h11001 and type 1 diabetes/h11002patients. importantly, we found a signiﬁcant positive relationship between cognitive functioning and functional connectiv-ity, suggesting changes in functional connectivity areinvolved in cognitive dysfunction in type 1 diabeticpatients. our data support the hypothesis that cerebral changes are related to the presence of microvascular complica-tions. however, we also found indications that cerebraland cognitive changes may be present before microvascu-lar complications become apparent. it could be hypothe-sized that chronic hyperglycemia, even in the absence ofclinically detectable microvascular complications, cannegatively affect cognitive functioning and cerebral com-munication. it is known that hyperglycemia as such leadsto a cascade of changes, including increases in formationof reactive oxygen species and advanced glycation endproducts (38,39), as well as activation of the hypothalamic-pituitary-adrenal axis (40), which could have an effect onthe brain. effects of hypoglycemia, particularly of asymp-tomatic hypoglycemic episodes because of hypoglycemiaunawareness, cannot be completely ruled out as a contrib-utor. subsequently, we corrected for severe hypoglycemicevents. this did not change the results (supplementarytable 2 a–c, available in an online appendix). another possible contributor to the altered functional connectivity and cognitive functions observed in type 1diabetic patients may be cerebrovascular, that is, macro-vascular disease, the subclinical form of which can beestimated by ultrasound measurements of the carotidintima media thickness, which is known to be increased inasymptomatic type 1 diabetic patients relative to theirnondiabetic peers (41). furthermore, early diabetes onset,deﬁned as disease onset before 7 years of age, has beenshown previously to negatively affect intellectual andcognitive performance and cerebral structure (42,43). some limitations of this study should be mentioned. first, meg provides a high temporal resolution. unfortu-nately, the spatial resolution is lower. for a higher spatialresolution fmri is currently the method of choice. further-more, the cognitive tests chosen had the highest sensitivityto detect cognitive changes. however, these tests may notbe sufﬁciently sensitive to detect very subtle changes intype 1 diabetes–associated cognitive decline. second, ageof disease onset and subsequently disease duration differbetween the patient groups. although the percentages ofearly disease onset do not statistically differ betweengroups, for the type 1 diabetes /h11001patients age of onset reﬂects childhood and early adolescence, whereas for the type 1 diabetes/h11002patients it reﬂects late adolescence and early adulthood. in a subsequent analysis we compared both patient groups, additionally correcting for age ofdiabetes onset and diabetes duration (see supplementarytable 3 a–c, available in an online appendix). taking into account the risk of emerging power problems when addingtwo more covariates to this small sample, these adjust-ments did not essentially change the conclusions regard-ing cognitive functioning and functional connectivity.disease duration might be less of a confounder here as thetype 1 diabetes /h11002patients had an average disease duration of almost 20 years, which is sufﬁcient for complications to develop. as stated before, an increase in functional con-nectivity was found for the lower /h9251band in type 1 diabetes/h11002patients. although the possibility of a statistical aberration cannot be completely ruled out, synchroniza-tion likelihood tended to be higher for 20 of the 23 anatomical locations of the lower /h9251band in type 1 diabetes/h11002patients than control subjects (supplementary table 4, available in an online appendix). moreover, we additionally repeated the post hoc mancova for thelower /h9251band correcting for multiple comparisons. this did not change the statistical signiﬁcance of the parietooc-cipital pathway. thus, these ﬁndings suggest that thesigniﬁcant increase detected is valid. as both age anddepressive symptoms differed between groups, we statis-tically corrected for both variables in all analyses. supple-mentary table 5, available in an online appendix,summarizes the relation between age and depressivesymptoms and cognitive and meg variables. third, a1cvalues over the time period preceding meg recording andneuropsychological assessment unfortunately were notavailable. in conclusion, this study showed that changes in func- tional brain connectivity and cognitive function exist intype 1 diabetic patients with and without microvascularcomplications. furthermore, interactions between func-tional connectivity and cognitive domains have been dem-onstrated. whether these abnormalities have clinicalimplications remains to be determined. longitudinal re-search in larger samples is required to determine thepredictive clinical value of our ﬁndings for the progressionof cognitive deterioration in type 1 diabetic patients aswell as its potential to serve as clinical outcomeparameter. acknowledgments this research was supported by grant 2005.00.06 of thedutch diabetes research foundation. no potential conﬂicts of interest relevant to this article were
